<h2>The
Weird Witch of the Willow-Herb</h2>



<p>The Weird Witch of the Willow-Herb lived
in a pink cottage on the top of a hill.
She was merry and beautiful and wise and
kind; and she was all dressed in pink and
green, and she had great eyes that were sometimes
filled with laughter and sometimes filled
with tears, and her round soft mouth looked as
though it had done nothing but smile for hundreds
and hundreds of years. Her pink cottage
was the most charming place in the world
to live in; the walls were made of the flower
of the willow-herb, and the roof was made of the
green leaves, and the floors were made of the
white down; and all the little lattice windows
were cobwebs, spun by the spiders who live in
Fairyland and make the windows for the Fairy
Queen's own palace. And no one but a wymp
or a fairy could have said how long the Weird
Witch of the Willow-Herb had been living in
her cottage on the top of the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, any one might think that this wonderful
Witch was so sweet and so wise that
all sorts of people would be coming, all day
long, to ask her to help them; for, of course,
that is what a witch is for. But this particular
Witch, who lived in her pink cottage on the
top of the hill, had not been living there all
that time for nothing.</p>

<p>"If I did not keep a few spells lying about
at the bottom of the hill, I should never have
a moment's peace," chuckled the Witch of the
Willow-Herb. And that is why most of the
people who came to ask her for spells never
got so far as the pink cottage at all, for they
found what they wanted at the bottom of the
hill; and no doubt that saved everybody a
great deal of trouble.</p>

<p>"Poor people!" said the Weird Witch, with
her voice full of kindness; "why should I
make them climb up all this way, just to see
me?"</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, it did happen that
somebody got to the top of the hill; or else
it is clear that this story would never have
been written. For, one day, as the Witch
sat on the doorstep of her pink cottage, looking
out over the world with her great eyes
that saw everything, the little Princess Win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>some
came running up the white path that
twisted round and round and up and up until
it reached the cottage at the top; and she did
not stop running until she stood in front
of the Weird Witch herself. She looked as
though she must have come along in a great
hurry, for she had lost one of her shoes on the
way and there was quite an important scratch
on her dimpled chin; but, of course, it is difficult
to walk sedately when one is going to call
on a witch.</p>

<p>"I am Princess Winsome," she announced,
as soon as she had breath enough to speak.</p>

<p>"To be sure you are," smiled the Weird
Witch, who knew that before; "and you have
run away from home because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because I want to find the bravest boy in
the world," interrupted the Princess, who never
liked to let anybody else do the talking.</p>

<p>"Are they all cowards in your country,
then?" asked the Witch.</p>

<p>"Oh no," answered Princess Winsome; "the
boys in my country are so brave that it is no
fun playing with them. They stop all the
games by fighting about nothing at all; and
it's dreadfully dull when you're a girl,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is," smiled the Witch. "Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
why are you looking for the bravest boy of
all?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said the little Princess, wisely, "the
bravest boy of all would never fight unless
there was a reason, you see; and so we should
have lots of time to play. But how am I to
find him?"</p>

<p>"The only way to find him is to let him find
you," said the Weird Witch; "and the best
thing I can do for you is to shut you up in
the middle of an enchanted forest, where no
one but the bravest boy in the world would
ever come to find any one. Now, make haste,
or you won't get there in time!"</p>

<p>And the Princess with the scratch on her
chin must certainly have made haste, for she
had quite disappeared by the time the Witch's
next visitor came up the winding white path;
and that happened the very next minute. This
time it was a boy who came along,&mdash;a tall,
strong, jolly-looking boy, with his hands in his
pockets and his cap at the back of his head,
whistling a strange wild tune that was made
up of all the songs of all the birds in the air,
so that, as he whistled it, every bird for miles
round stopped to listen.</p>

<p>"I am Kit the Coward," he said, pulling off
his cap to the Witch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"To be sure you are," smiled the Weird
Witch, who knew that too; "and you have
run away from home because the other boys
called you a coward, and you want to show
them that you are as brave as they are, only
you won't fight without a reason. Isn't that
it?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is," answered Kit, who liked
to have <i>his</i> talking done for him; "but how
shall I find something worth fighting about?"</p>

<p>"That is not difficult," said the Weird Witch.
"All you have to do is to go to the court of
King Hurlyburly, and ask him to give you
something brave to do. The King is always
going to war about something, so you will
soon have as much fighting as you want.
Now, be off with you, or else someone will
get there before you!"</p>

<p>"All right," said Kit. "Which is the way?"</p>

<p>"Any way you like," laughed the Weird
Witch.</p>

<p>"But in what direction?" asked Kit.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," laughed the Weird
Witch.</p>

<p>So Kit made her another bow and marched
away again down the hill-side, whistling the
same tune as before; and all the birds of the
air came flying along when they heard it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and they flew in front of him to show him
the way, and he followed them over meadows
and streams and orchards and cornfields,
until they brought him to the walls of King
Hurlyburly's city. And they would not have
left him then, if he had not pointed out to
them, most politely, that although it was very
obliging of them to have come so far with
him, he would find it a little inconvenient to
travel any further with so many companions.
So they flew away again; and Kit marched
into the city and up to the gates of the King's
palace.</p>

<p>"I have come to fight for the King," said
Kit, when the guards came out and asked him
what he wanted. And he looked such a fine
strong fellow, that they took him at once to
the King.</p>

<p>"You have come in the very nick of time,"
said King Hurlyburly, "for the Commander-in-Chief
of the royal forces has overslept himself
so often that I had him beheaded this
morning before he was awake. The army is
in consequence without a head as well as the
Commander-in-Chief; so if you will become
their General and invade the country of my
neighbour King Topsyturvy, I shall be much
obliged to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why have I got to invade the country of
King Topsyturvy?" demanded Kit.</p>

<p>The King pushed his crown on one side,
which he always did when he felt puzzled.
"Now you come to mention it," he said, "I
believe there <i>was</i> a reason, but for the life of
me I can't remember what it was. However,
the reason is of no importance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it is," interrupted Kit. "I can't
possibly fight without a reason, you know."</p>

<p>"That's awkward," said King Hurlyburly.
"Perhaps the army will know." And he sent
a message round to the barracks to ask the
soldiers why they were going to war. But
although the soldiers were all ready to begin
fighting, they had not the least idea what the
war was about. So the King's crown became
more crooked than before.</p>

<p>"Won't it do if you invent a reason?" he
asked Kit, for he could not help thinking how
nice it would be to stay at home while his
soldiers were being led to war by someone
else. "You may marry the Princess Winsome
if you come back victorious," he added
as an afterthought.</p>

<p>But Kit only shook his head. He had
never heard of the Princess Winsome, and he
was not going to fight anybody without a very
good reason for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Then King Hurlyburly had a brilliant idea.
"Go and declare war on the enemy, to begin
with," he said; "and perhaps <i>they</i> will remember
the reason."</p>

<p>There was certainly no harm in declaring
war; so Kit rode off at once on one of the
King's fastest horses, and arrived the next
morning at the court of King Topsyturvy, just
as his Majesty was sitting down to breakfast.</p>

<p>"I have come from King Hurlyburly to
declare war," said Kit, who always went
straight to the point.</p>

<p>"What for?" asked King Topsyturvy.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Kit. "That's what I
want you to tell me."</p>

<p>The King ate two eggs before he replied.</p>

<p>"Well," he said presently, "I believe I said
Hurlyburly was a shocking old muddler. I
suppose that's it. All right! When do you
want to begin?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to begin at all," answered Kit.
"Why did you say he was a muddler?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just to make conversation," said King
Topsyturvy, helping himself to marmalade.</p>

<p>"Then you don't really think he is an old
muddler?" asked Kit.</p>

<p>"Dear me, no," said King Topsyturvy. "I
never think."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then write that down on a piece of paper,
and there needn't be a war at all!" cried Kit.</p>

<p>The King stroked his beard. "Perhaps
there needn't," he agreed. "But I never
write."</p>

<p>"I do, though," said Kit, who had learned
to write while all the other boys were making
catapults; "you've only got to sign your
name here."</p>

<p>King Topsyturvy stopped eating his breakfast,
just long enough to sign the beautiful
apology Kit had written on a sheet of note-paper;
and then Kit jumped on his horse
again and rode back to the palace of King
Hurlyburly.</p>

<p>"Well," said his Majesty, "did you discover
the reason?"</p>

<p>"There wasn't a reason, and there isn't
going to be a war," answered Kit; and he held
out the beautifully written apology from King
Topsyturvy.</p>

<p>"What!" cried his Majesty, in alarm.
"Do you mean to say you've stopped the
war?"</p>

<p>"Of course I have," said Kit. "And I have
come back victorious, as you see. Didn't you
say something about a Princess?"</p>

<p>"But," stammered the King, "how am I to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
appease the army? The army has set its
heart on a war."</p>

<p>"So had I," answered Kit, sadly; "but I
never can find anything worth fighting about.
Meanwhile, where is the Princess?"</p>

<p>"You have not won the Princess," said King
Hurlyburly, who was now thoroughly cross.
"I believe you are a miserable coward!"</p>

<p>"That is what the other boys say," answered
Kit, smiling. "It is not my fault that there is
nothing to fight about. Will you please send
for the Princess?"</p>

<p>"The Princess has run away from home, so
I can't send for her," said the King, irritably.
"She is shut up in an enchanted forest, and
surrounded with wild beasts and magic spells
and giants. It is not at all a nice place for a
Princess to be in, but how am I to get her
away?"</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed Kit, laughing, "here is
something for your army to do. Let it go
and rescue the Princess."</p>

<p>"Nothing would induce the army to go near
the place," explained the King, sorrowfully;
"the army is too much afraid of being bewitched."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted Kit, laughing more
than ever. "At last I have found something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
brave to do! <i>I</i> will go and rescue the Princess."</p>

<p>So Kit the Coward started out on his travels
once more; and no sooner did he get outside
the city gates than he began to whistle his
wonderful tune, and down swept all the birds
of the air in hundreds, and they flew in front
of him as before and led him to the very edge
of the enchanted forest. There they left him,
for no one can help anybody to go through an
enchanted forest, and Kit knew fast enough
that he must find the Princess by himself.
He was not a bit afraid, though, and he plunged
straight into the wood without looking back.</p>

<p>He had not taken two steps before he had
completely lost himself. The trees were so
thick overhead that not a streak of sunshine
was able to get through, and the forest was so
full of wild beasts that it was impossible to
walk five yards without tumbling over a lion
or a bear. But this did not frighten Kit at
all, for he had learned to talk the language of
the woods all the time that the other boys
were knocking one another on the head; and
so he soon made friends with every animal in
the forest, and they told him the best places to
find apples and nuts and blackberries, and the
bees brought him the very best honey they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
could make, and he grew so happy and so
contented that he quite forgot he was enchanted
and could not escape if he wanted to.</p>

<p>But it is impossible to be happy for long
when one is bewitched; and, one day, Kit
found himself in a part of the forest that was
more horrible and more frightening than any
dark passage that was ever invented on the
way to any nursery. It was not only dark, but
it was strangely silent as well; and a curious
feeling of gloom and unhappiness suddenly
crept over Kit. If it had been a nice sort of
silence, the sort we find when we get away
from the other boys and girls into a place
where it is quiet enough to hear the real
sounds of the air, Kit would still have been
quite happy; but here there was nothing to be
heard at all, not even the brushing of the
leaves, nor the blooming of the flowers, nor
the growing of the grass. But the most
frightening thing of all was when he clapped
his hands together and stamped as hard as he
could on the ground, for not a sound did he
make; and when he tried to speak, he found
he could only whisper; and when he burst out
laughing, he made no more noise than if he
had been smiling. Still, he kept his wits
about him, for, of course, there was the Prin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>cess
to be rescued, and at last he thought of
trying to whistle. At first he could not make
a note sound in the stillness, but he went on
trying until the wonderful tune he had learned
long ago from the birds themselves began to
echo once more through the silent forest.</p>

<p>He did not get an answer at once, for really
nice birds cannot be expected to go out of
their way to a place where there is no sunshine
and the flowers cannot enter into conversation
with them; but after a while a very fat blackbird,
who certainly had impudence enough for
anything, came hopping along from branch to
branch until he landed on Kit's shoulder, and
with him came sunshine and sound and merriment
into the very heart of the melancholy
forest, for none of these things are ever far
off when a blackbird is near. Kit gave a
shout of joy and hastened after the blackbird,
who was hopping along the ground in front of
him; and the next minute he found himself
standing in a blaze of sunlight in front of a
high stone wall. Beyond the wall he could
see the tall towers of a great castle; but he
did not trouble himself much about the other
side of the wall, for on the top of it, with the
sunshine pouring all over her, sat the most
charming little girl he had ever seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>She had lost one of her shoes, and there was
the faintest sign of a scratch on her round,
dimpled chin, and her long black hair flowed
round her shoulders in a way that some people
might have called untidy; but Kit was sure,
directly he saw her, that she had come straight
out of Fairyland, and he was too amazed even
to make her a bow.</p>

<p>"Dear me! What are you doing here?"
asked the girl, in a tone of great surprise.</p>

<p>Kit took a step nearer the wall, and pulled
off his cap. Her voice reminded him that,
although she belonged to Fairyland, she was
still a little girl and would expect him to remember
his manners. "I have come to rescue
the Princess," he said. "Can you tell me where
she is?"</p>

<p>"She lives in the castle over there," answered
the girl. "What are you going to
do when you have rescued her?"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I shall ask her to marry
me," said Kit. "Do you think she will?"</p>

<p>"Ah," she replied gravely, "that depends on
whether you have <i>my</i> permission. Tell me
who you are, to begin with."</p>

<p>"I am Kit the Coward," he said simply; and
he stared when she broke into the merriest
peal of laughter imaginable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"What nonsense!" she cried. "If you were
a coward, you would never have got here at
all."</p>

<p>"Is that true?" asked Kit eagerly. "Then
do you think the Princess <i>will</i> marry me?"</p>

<p>The girl looked down at him for a moment,
with her untidy little head on one side. Then
she bent and held out her two hands to him.
"I think, perhaps, the Princess will," she said
softly. "If you will help me down from this
enormous high wall, we will go and ask her."</p>

<p>So Kit lifted her down from the wall, which
was quite an easy matter, for it was in reality
no higher than he was and the little girl was
certainly the lightest weight he had ever held
in his arms. "What are you looking for?" he
asked, when he had set her on the ground, for
she was kneeling down and turning over the
dry leaves in a most distressed manner.</p>

<p>"I am looking for my crown, of course," she
said with a pout; "it tumbled off my head just
before you came, and I was too frightened to
jump all that long way to find it."</p>

<p>"Here it is," said Kit; and he picked up the
little glittering crown and set it gently on the
top of her beautiful, rumpled hair. Then he
started back in surprise. "You are the Princess!"
he shouted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course I am," laughed Princess Winsome,
putting her hand in his; "<i>I</i> knew that,
all the time! Shall we go home now?"</p>

<p>Kit did not reply immediately, for no one
can do two things at once, and it took him
quite a long time to kiss the small soft hand
that lay in his own big one. And as for going
home, when they did start they did not get
very far; for it must not be forgotten that they
were still in an enchanted forest, and it is
easier to get into an enchanted forest than to
get out of it again. However, as they had
everything in the world to talk about, they
would probably have been most annoyed if
they had found their way instead of losing it;
so they just went on losing it as happily as
possible, until they could not walk another
step because an immense giant was occupying
the whole of the roadway. There he sat,
smoking a great pipe that looked like a chimney-pot
that wanted sweeping; and when the
Princess saw him, she was so frightened that
she hid herself behind Kit and peeped under
his arm to see what was going to happen.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said the giant, in a huge voice
that made the grass stand on end with fright,
just as it does after a hoar-frost; "what's
this? You're running away with the Princess!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"To be sure I am," said Kit; "and if you
don't let me pass, I shall have to kill you."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," sighed the giant, raising a wind
that made the trees shiver for miles round.
"They all say that, and there's no peace for
a poor giant now-a-days. When I was a boy,
the Prince was always put under a spell as
well as the Princess. However, I suppose I
must make an end of you, if you are determined
to fight."</p>

<p>And he laid down his pipe and rose most
unwillingly to his feet.</p>

<p>Kit laughed out loud with gladness, for at
last he had found a good reason for a fight,
and no one would be able to call him a coward
any more. But before there was time to strike
a single blow, the giant gave a loud howl
of alarm, took to his heels, and in another
moment was completely out of sight. Kit
turned in amazement to his little Princess;
and then he saw what had frightened the
giant, for all the animals of the forest, all
the lions and the tigers and the bears and the
wolves, stood there in rows, waiting to help
him. So there is no doubt that that giant
would have been killed by somebody if he had
not run away.</p>

<p>"Isn't it wonderful?" said the little Princess,
in a whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>But Kit covered his face with his hands.
"It is no use," he said in a disappointed tone;
"the other boys will never believe that I am
not a coward."</p>

<p>Princess Winsome came and pulled his hands
away and laughed softly. "<i>I</i> think you are
the bravest boy in the world," she said.</p>

<p>"Of course he is!" chuckled a voice somewhere
near. "How stupid some people are, to
be sure!" And there sat the Weird Witch
under a tree, all in her pink and green gown,
with her great eyes brimful of fun and nonsense.
And as the boy and girl stood hand in
hand before her and caught the glance of her
beautiful witch's eyes, all sorts of muddles fell
out of their heads, and they began to understand
everything that had been puzzling them
for years and years and years. That only shows
what a witch can do when she is the right sort
of witch!</p>

<p>"Dear little Princess," cried Kit, "it doesn't
matter whether the other boys believe me or
not, so long as <i>you</i> know I am not a coward."</p>

<p>"Besides," added Princess Winsome, "we
are not going to try to make anybody believe
anything. I think we'll stay here, instead, for
ever and ever and always."</p>

<p>"A very good idea," smiled the Weird Witch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of the Willow-Herb, as she nodded at them
both. "Always remain enchanted if you can."</p>

<p>So they had the nicest and the funniest wedding
possible, on the spot; and there was no
time wasted in sending out invitations, for all
the guests were already waiting there in rows&mdash;with
the exception of the singing-birds;
and Kit very soon summoned them by whistling
a few notes of his wonderful tune. The
Princess laid her own wedding-breakfast under
the trees, and the wedding-guests helped her
by bringing her everything that was nice to
eat in the forest, such as roasted chestnuts
and preserved fruits and truffles and barley-sugar-cane,
and lots of dewdrops and honey-drops
and pear-drops; and the Weird Witch
completed the feast by turning a piece of rock
that nobody wanted into a wedding-cake, and
every one will agree that it is better for a rock to
turn into a wedding-cake than for a wedding-cake
to turn into a rock. And all the flowers came
of their own accord and arranged themselves on
the table, which they certainly did much more
prettily than anybody else could have done it
for them; and when the wedding was over they
just walked away again instead of stopping
until they were dead, which of course is what
they would have done at any other wedding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
And although the bride had lost her other shoe
by the time she was ready to be married, and
although her beautiful hair was more untidy
than ever and her crown had tumbled off again
and had to be brought to her by an obliging
lion, Kit never noticed any of these things and
only felt quite certain that he was marrying somebody
who had come right out of Fairyland and
was not an ordinary Princess at all. No doubt,
it was because he was in an enchanted forest
that he made such a mistake; and no doubt,
it is because he has never been disenchanted
since that he is making the same mistake to
this day.</p>

<p>As for the Weird Witch of the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'WillowHerb'">Willow-Herb</ins>,
she went back to her pink cottage on the top
of the hill, so as to be ready to make the next
person happy who came up the white winding
path. But before she went, she took care that
all the singing-birds should fly back to Kit's
home and tell the other boys how brave he had
been, which they did with the greatest pleasure
imaginable. It is said that the story
became slightly exaggerated; but when we
know how much one little bird can tell, it is
not difficult to imagine the kind of story that
could be told by hundreds and hundreds of
little birds.</p>

<p>Little King Wistful slipped through the
palace gates and went out into his kingdom
to look for something new. He was only
eight years old, so he was not a very big King;
but he had been King as long as he could
remember, and he had been looking for something
new the whole time. Now, his kingdom
was entirely made of islands, and in the
days when the old King and Queen were alive
these islands were known as the Cheerful Isles.
But King Wistful changed their name soon
after he came to the throne, and insisted on
their being called the Monotonous Isles. For,
strange as it may sound, this little King of
eight years old thought his kingdom was the
dullest and the ugliest and the most wearisome
place in the world, and nothing that his
nurses or his councillors could do ever succeeded
in making him laugh and play like
other little boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only look at the stupid things!" muttered
his Majesty impatiently, as he stood and surveyed
his kingdom from the top of a small,
grassy hillock. "Five round islands in a row;
always five round islands in a row! If only
some of them were square, it would be something!"</p>

<p>At the bottom of the hill was a wood, one of
those pale-green baby woods, where the trees
are young and slender and nothing grows very
plentifully except the bracken and the heather.
And as the King stood and felt sorry for himself
at the top of the hill, out from the wood at
the bottom of the hill came the sound of a
little girl's voice, singing a quaint little song.
And this was the song:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Sing-song! Don't be long!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Wistful, Wistful, come and play!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sing-song! It's very wrong</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">To stay and stay and stay away!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The world is much too nice a place</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To make you pull so long a face;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It's full of people being kind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And full of flowers for you to find;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There's heaps of folks for you to tease</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And all the naughtiness you please;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To sulk is surely waste of time</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When all those trees are yours to climb!</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ting-a-ring! Make haste, King!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">I've something really nice to say;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ting-a-ring! A <i>proper</i> King</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Would not make me sing all day!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>King Wistful thrilled all over with excitement.
Was something really going to happen
at last? He had hardly time to think, however,
before the little singer came out of the
wood into the open. She wore a clean white
pinafore, and on her head was a large white
sunbonnet, and under the sunbonnet were two
of the brightest brown eyes the King had ever
seen. He stepped down the hill towards her,
wondering how anything so pretty and so
merry could have come into his kingdom;
and at the same instant the little girl saw the
King and came running up the hill towards
him, so it was not long before they stood
together, hand in hand, half-way down the
hillside.</p>

<p>"Where did you come from and who are
you and how long have you been here?"
asked the King, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"I am Eyebright, of course," answered
the little girl, smiling; "and I've been here
always."</p>

<p>"Who taught you to sing that song about
me?" demanded the King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"The magician," answered Eyebright; "and
he told me to sing it every day until you came.
But you <i>have</i> been a long time coming!"</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry," replied his Majesty, apologetically;
"you see, the magician did not tell
me to come. In fact, I don't even know who
the magician is."</p>

<p>"Are you not the King, then?" asked Eyebright,
opening her great brown eyes as wide
as they would go.</p>

<p>The little King felt it was hardly necessary
to answer this; but he set his heels together
and took off his crown and made her the best
bow he had learned at his dancing-class, just
to show beyond any doubt that he was the
King. Eyebright still looked a little doubtful.</p>

<p>"Then how is it that you do not know the
magician?" she asked him. "What is the use
of being King, if you do not know everybody
who lives in your kingdom?"</p>

<p>"It isn't any use; I never said I wanted to
be King, did I?" said his Majesty, a little
crossly. It was not pleasant to find that
somebody else, and only a little girl in a sunbonnet,
knew more about his kingdom than he did.</p>

<p>"What a very funny boy you are!" remarked
Eyebright, without noticing his crossness. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
always thought it must be so splendid to be
a King, and to have a banquet whenever you
like, and never to go out without a procession,
and to wear a crown instead of a sunbonnet,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all you know about it," interrupted
the King, somewhat impolitely. "There aren't
any banquets; and when there are, you only
have stupid things with long names to eat, and
you never know whether to eat them with a
fork or a spoon, and it's always wrong whichever
you do. And if you ask for jumbles or
chocolate creams or plum-cake, you're told
you mustn't spoil your dinner. And all the
procession you ever get is a procession of
nurses, who won't even let you step in a
puddle if you want to!"</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Eyebright, "you're no
better off than a little boy in an ordinary
nursery!"</p>

<p>The little King drew himself up on tiptoe
with great dignity. "Some of your remarks
are most foolish," he said. "You forget that
I have a kingdom of my own as well as a
nursery. To be sure," he added sadly, "it is
not much to boast of, for it is a very stupid
kingdom, and nothing nice ever happens in it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" exclaimed Eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>bright.
"Your kingdom is the nicest kingdom
in the whole world!"</p>

<p>King Wistful had managed to keep his
temper so far, but this was more than he could
bear. "Rubbish!" he cried, completely forgetting
his royal manners. "You come up
the hill with me, and I'll show you what a
stupid kingdom it is."</p>

<p>So they raced up to the top of the hill and
looked down at the five round islands in a
row. "There!" said King Wistful. "Did
you ever see anything so dull?"</p>

<p>The little girl shook her head. "I think
it is all as pretty as it can be," she said.
"Look how the sun glints on the cornfields,
and see the great red and blue patches of
flowers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But they're always the same flowers," complained
his Majesty, yawning.</p>

<p>"They're supposed to be the same flowers,
but they never are," answered Eyebright. "If
you were to pick them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kings never pick flowers," he replied
haughtily.</p>

<p>"Perhaps that is why you know so little
about them," retorted Eyebright; and his Majesty
began to feel he was not getting the best
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anyhow," he continued hastily, "you must
own that the sea never changes."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Eyebright; "that is because
you have not learned the sea properly. It has
ever so many different faces, and ever so many
different voices, too."</p>

<p>The King turned and stared at her. "Are
you a witch?" he asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>"No!" laughed Eyebright, merrily. "If I
were, I would make you see things right instead
of wrong." Then she suddenly scampered
down the hill again. "Come along,
<i>quick</i>!" she cried. "We'll go and ask the
magician to disenchant you."</p>

<p>King Wistful had to run his hardest to catch
her, for the little girl in the sunbonnet certainly
knew how to put one foot in front of
the other. But then, a sunbonnet is not so
apt to tumble off a person's head as a crown,
and that makes all the difference in a running
race.</p>

<p>"Where does the magician live?" he panted,
when he came up with her.</p>

<p>"In the middle island," she answered.
"We'll find the boat and follow the river
down to the sea." She plunged into the
wood as she spoke, and threaded her way
through the slender young trees, with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Majesty close at her heels. Sometimes the
bracken was as tall as she was, but the boy
behind could always see the sunbonnet bobbing
up and down just ahead of him, and he
followed it until they came out at the other
side of the wood and found themselves on the
banks of a charming little river. A small
round boat like a tub, lined with pink rose-leaves,
was waiting for them; and into this
they both jumped.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" cried Eyebright, jumping up and
down with delight. "The fairies are out to-day!
Look at them&mdash;the purple ones in the
loosestrife, and the pink and white ones in the
comfrey, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll upset the boat if you don't sit still,"
interrupted the King, who felt cross because
he could not see the fairies. "Let me have
the oars and I'll take you down the stream."</p>

<p>"You need not do anything of the sort,"
said Eyebright; "for this is the boat the magician
gave me, and it always takes you wherever
you want to go."</p>

<p>So they just sat in the sunshine and floated
lazily along, and they dabbled their hands in
the water and made their sleeves as wet as
they pleased, and they caught at the branches
above as they passed under them, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
leaned over the side and stretched after everything
that grew out of reach; and, in short, if
they had not been in a fairy boat, it is very
certain that they would have tumbled into the
water several times before they reached their
journey's end. Presently, the river widened
out into the big calm sea; and after that, the
boat quickened its speed and took them across
to the middle island in no time at all, for the
fairies know well enough that nobody wants
to dawdle about in an open sea, where there
are no tadpoles to catch and no trees that
sweep their branches down to meet the water.</p>

<p>When the boat stopped, they found themselves
on the edge of a shore covered with sea-lilac
and yellow poppies, and wonderful shells
that sang without being put to any one's ear;
and just a little way along the beach was the
magician's cave. There was no doubt about
its being the right cave, for over the door of it
was written in square acid tablets: "This is
the magician's cave." Besides, the whole cave
was dug out of a solid almond rock; and of
course, any other person's cave would have been
made of plain rock without any almonds in it.</p>

<p>"Come along," said Eyebright; and the two
children walked up the beach and knocked at
the magician's door and went in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Some people might think that a cave on the
sea-shore would be full of draughts and jellyfish
and wet shrimps; but this particular cave
was just like the nicest room that ever belonged
to a castle-in-the-air. The wonder of it
was, that whoever went into it found the very
things he had never had and always wanted,
and none of the things that he had always had
and never wanted. So Eyebright immediately
found a beautiful story-book, with a coloured
picture on every page, and all the sad stories
squeezed between the happy stories, so that no
one who read it could ever cry for long at a
time; while the King found the inside of a
clock waiting to be picked to pieces, and an
open pocket-knife with a bit of firewood lying
handy, and a full-rigged schooner ready to be
sailed. And they both saw the dear old magician,
sitting in his arm-chair and smiling at
them.</p>

<p>He was dressed in a long cloak, that always
began by being a green cloak but changed
every other minute to a different colour, according
to the mood the magician was in; and
as he was always in a nice mood, whether it was
a sad or a merry one, his cloak always managed
to be a nice colour. On his head was a
high pointed hat, with crackers sticking out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of it and a pattern worked all over it in caramels
and preserved cherries; and he wore furry
foxgloves on his hands to keep them warm,
because he was not so young as he used to be.
He had been practising as a magician for over
a thousand years, but he did not look very old,
for all that; he was what might be called
pleasantly old, for he had soft white hair and
a curly white beard and a pink complexion like
a school-boy's. That is how a magician grows
old when he has always been a jolly magician.</p>

<p>Eyebright ran straight up to him and
climbed on his knee and hugged him. "I've
brought the King to see you," she announced;
"and we want you to be a nice, kind, <i>lovely</i>
magician and help him to be disenchanted."</p>

<p>The magician stood up and shook hands
with the King, just to make him feel at home;
and the boy did not feel shy another minute,
and quite forgot that he had never paid a visit
before without a procession of nurses to look
after him.</p>

<p>"You are very good children to call on me
at tea-time," said the magician. "If there is
one thing more than another that makes me
feel the ache in my bones, it is having tea by
myself. Now, would you like to have it on
the floor, or shall I call up a table?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The King, who had had his meals on a table
all his life, voted for the floor; but when Eyebright
said it would be more fun to see what
would happen if they chose the table, he had
to own that perhaps she was right. What happened
was very simple: the magician just
stamped on the floor, and a neat little table,
covered with a nice white cloth, walked in at
the door like any person and took up its position
in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed Eyebright; "I never
knew tables could walk, before!"</p>

<p>"What do you suppose they have four legs
for?" asked the magician, smiling.</p>

<p>"My nursery table does not walk," observed
the little King.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the magician, wisely, "some
tables do not know how to put two and two
together. Now for some chairs!"</p>

<p>He stamped on the floor again, and two
little arm-chairs bustled into the room as fast
as their fat little legs would carry them. "You
must excuse their being in such a hurry," said
the magician; "they have been playing at
musical chairs all their lives, you see. Now,
while you are laying the table, I will boil the
kettle. Crockery in the left-hand cupboard, and
eatables in the right-hand cupboard!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>So the magician set to work and lighted the
fire with peppermint-sticks, and the two children
opened the doors of his wonderful cupboards.
The crockery in the left-hand cupboard
was the right sort of crockery, for none of it
matched; so it did not take a minute to find a
small pink cup and a green saucer for Eyebright,
and a big blue cup and a red saucer for
the magician, and a nice purple mug without
any saucer at all for King Wistful. As for
the right-hand cupboard, the little King was
overjoyed when he found it stocked with
jumbles and chocolate creams and plum-cake.
"I <i>am</i> glad," he said with a sigh of relief,
"that you don't keep seed-cake in your cupboard.
Seed-cake always reminds me of eleven
o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the magician, "the wymps saw
to that, when they filled my cupboard for me,
centuries ago. There's never any bread-and-butter
in it, either&mdash;until you've had as much
plum-cake as you can eat."</p>

<p>That was a delightful tea-party. The magician
did not mind in the least when they made
polite remarks about the food and told him his
jumbles might have been kept a little longer
with advantage, or that his chocolate creams
were not quite so soft as some they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
known. But they hastened to add that his
tea was the nicest tea they had ever tasted
because it had only a grown-up amount of
milk in it, so he would have been rather a
cross magician if he had minded. Nor did he
raise any objection when they walked about in
the middle of tea and took a look at the picture-book,
or whittled away the piece of firewood, or
danced round the cave and shouted because
everything was so nice. And after tea there
were all the magician's treasures to be turned
out of odd nooks and corners and left about
on the floor, and all his new quill pens to be
tried, and his clean sheets of note-paper to be
scribbled over. And when they were tired of
exploring the cave and had eaten as much
plum-cake as they wanted, the magician saw
it was the right moment to begin telling them
really true stories; and as he was a magician,
of course his true stories were all fairy stories,
which, as every one knows, are the only true
stories in the world worth believing. But
even the stories came to an end at last, and
then both the children remembered at once
why they had come to see the magician.</p>

<p>"Well, what can I do for you?" he asked,
before they had time to say anything; for,
truly, he would not have been a magician at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
all if he had not known what they were thinking
about. He smiled so encouragingly that
the little King answered him at once.</p>

<p>"It's like this," he began, "there's something
wrong with the way I see things."</p>

<p>"Of course there is," said the magician:
"the wymps threw dust in your eyes when you
were a baby; and you cannot expect to see
things in the same light as other people when
the wymps have once thrown dust in your
eyes."</p>

<p>"Why did they throw dust in my eyes?"
asked little King Wistful.</p>

<p>"Usual reason," answered the magician,
briefly. "They were not asked to your christening,
that's all. If people will persist in
leaving the wymps out when they give a
party, they must take the consequences.
However, as you were not to blame in the
matter, the wymps would be the first to own
that you ought not to be bewymped any
longer. The best thing you can do is to go
up to Wympland yourself and ask them to
take away the spell."</p>

<p>The little King looked at Eyebright and
hesitated. "It is a long way to go all alone,"
he remarked; and Eyebright immediately
stepped up to him and took his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll come with you," she said; "I've
always longed to go to the other side of the
sun. How are we to get there, magician?"</p>

<p>"Well," answered the magician, "the usual
way is to climb up a sunbeam, but that's not
very quick and sunbeams are apt to be slippery
in the dry weather. Shall I send you up in a
flash of lightning or on the spur of a lark?"</p>

<p>"Spur of a lark!" echoed the King. "You
mean on the spur of a moment, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," answered the magician;
"you'd never get up to Wympland on the
spur of anything but a lark, I can tell you!
You have to get up there very early in any
case, if you want to be even with the wymps;
so the best way is to rise with the lark. However,
as it is getting rather late in the day for
larks, I had better send you up in a lightning
flash. Will you manage it alone, or shall I
send a conductor with it?"</p>

<p>"Would the conductor show us the way?"
asked Eyebright.</p>

<p>"Dear me, no," said the magician. "Lightning
conductors never show anything but the
stupidity of some people. Perhaps you'd better
have the lightning without a conductor; so
stand on one side, while I pick you out a nice
quiet flash without any thunder hanging to it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>He took down a large sack, labelled <i>Storms</i>,
from the shelf, untied the top and plunged his
head into it. Eyebright stole a little closer to
the King than before and hoped that nothing
would go off with a bang.</p>

<p>"I say," said his Majesty, putting his arm
round her, "it strikes me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is impossible," interrupted the magician
in a stuffy voice from the middle of the
sack, "for I've got it in both hands, and it
isn't going to strike anybody so long as you
treat it kindly. Now, off you go in a flash!"</p>

<p>And off they did go in something, though
they never knew what it was, for they had no
time to see anything before they found themselves
dropped with a thud on the other side
of the sun. For a moment or two they just
lay where they had fallen without moving;
then they sat up and rubbed their eyes and
looked round.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Eyebright, clasping her
hands tight; "I had no idea it was like
this."</p>

<p>Of course Eyebright knew no more about
Wympland than she had learned in her geography
lessons, and we all know how little
geography books ever tell us about the really
nice places in the world. So, although she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
knew as well as any other little girl that
Wympland has no physical features and its
inhabitants have no occupation, that its
climate is dull and foggy and its government
is a sleeping monarchy, she was not in the
least prepared for what she did see.</p>

<p>"Well," said a voice somewhere near, "what
do you think of it?"</p>

<p>Just in front of them a wymp was standing
on his head, which is a wymp's favourite way
of resting his legs. He seemed to expect an
answer, so the King did his best to think of
one that should be both polite and truthful.
As a matter of fact, he did not think much
of Wympland at all.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it is rather full of fog, isn't it?" he
began, a little nervously.</p>

<p>The wymp looked distinctly hurt; but before
he had time to get angry Eyebright put things
right in her quiet little way.</p>

<p>"I don't think it is yellow fog," she said;
"it is more like dull sunshine."</p>

<p>The wymp fairly wympled when he heard
this.</p>

<p>"You've hit it!" he cried in a delighted
tone; "that's what it is really. It's the folks
from the front of the sun who call it yellow
fog; they're blinded by their own sunshine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
they are. This is the back of the sun, you
see, and the sunshine naturally loses a bit of
its polish by the time it has worked through."</p>

<p>"I think I like bright sunshine best," observed
the King.</p>

<p>"That is absurd!" said the wymp. "Why,
you can't look at it without blinking, to begin
with. In Wympland you get all the advantages
of the sun and none of the drawbacks,&mdash;no
sunblinds or sunstrokes or sunspots!
You must be a stupid boy if you can't see
that!"</p>

<p>"It is your fault, not mine," answered the
King boldly; "you shouldn't have thrown
dust in my eyes if you wanted me to see
Wympland in the right light!"</p>

<p>The wymp turned several somersaults to
show his amazement at the King's words, and
finally stood thoughtfully on one leg.</p>

<p>"That's serious," he said. "We didn't know
you'd ever come up here, or we shouldn't have
done it. However, it can't be helped now, so
you'd better go back again. It doesn't matter
if you <i>do</i> see things wrong&mdash;at the front of
the sun."</p>

<p>"But it does matter!" they both exclaimed;
"and that's why we want you to take away
the spell, please."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The wymp stood on his head again and
shook it from side to side, which no one but
a wymp could have done, considering the
awkwardness of the position. "There's only
one thing to be done," he said at last. "You
must exchange eyes."</p>

<p>They stared at the wymp and then at each
other. The little King began to think busily,
but Eyebright spoke without thinking at all.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said. "How is it to be
done?"</p>

<p>"Quite easy," answered the wymp, cheerfully.
"All you've got to do is to wish
with all your might to have the King's eyes
instead of your own, and there you are!"</p>

<p>At that moment the King finished his thinking.
"Stop!" he shouted. "If I take her eyes
away, <i>she</i> will always see things wrong!"</p>

<p>But the King had spoken too late. Eyebright
had already wished with all her might,
and her eyes had turned as blue as deep water
while his Majesty's were round and large and
brown.</p>

<p>"What fun!" she cried, laughing happily.
"Isn't it a nice change to have somebody
else's eyes?"</p>

<p>The little King, however, was far too furious
to listen to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stand up and let me knock you down!"
he cried, shaking his fist at the wymp. "Look
what you have done. She will see things
wrong to the end of her days!"</p>

<p>"Don't be a foolish little boy," said the
wymp, calmly. "Take her home and try to
see things right yourself."</p>

<p>The King certainly did not take her home,
nor himself either; but it is the truth that
they both found themselves, the very next
minute, standing on the top of the small green
hillock and looking down at the kingdom of
the Monotonous Isles.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted King Wistful, waving
his crown joyfully. "What a beautiful kingdom
I've got! Look how the sun glints on
the cornfields, and see the great red and blue
patches of flowers! Don't you think it <i>is</i> a
beautiful kingdom?" he added, turning to the
little girl in the sunbonnet.</p>

<p>Eyebright was distinctly puzzled. She
<i>thought</i> she only saw five round islands in
a row. But, of course, it was impossible
that the King should be mistaken. So she
looked once more over the kingdom of the
Monotonous Isles and then back at the anxious
face of the little King.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said softly, "it is, as you say, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
beautiful kingdom." Then she ran down the
hill and disappeared among the slender trees
of the baby wood, and little King Wistful
went home to bed.</p>

<p>There is a Queen now as well as a King of
the Monotonous Isles. She has black hair
and blue eyes, and she wears a crown instead
of a sunbonnet, and she quite agrees with the
King whenever he tells her how beautiful
their kingdom is. And if this should seem
remarkable to some people, it need only be
remembered that the Queen sees everything
with the King's eyes.</p>

<h2>The Hundredth Princess</h2>






<p>There was once a King who was so fond
of hunting that all the rabbits in his
kingdom were born with their hearts in their
mouths. The King would have been extremely
surprised to hear this, for, of course,
he never hunted anything so small as a rabbit;
but rabbits are foolish enough for anything, as
all the world knows, and it is certain that the
rabbits of the King's forest would never have
had a happy moment to this day, if the Green
Enchantress had not suddenly taken it into
her head to try and bewitch the King.</p>

<p>Now, the Green Enchantress was very beautiful
indeed. She sat all day long at the foot
of an old lime-tree in the royal forest, and she
was dressed all in green, and she had small
white hands and great black eyes and quantities
and quantities of dark red hair. Every
animal in the forest, from the largest wild boar
down to the smallest baby-rabbit, was a friend
of hers; and it made her dreadfully unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
when she saw them being killed just to amuse
the King. So it was no wonder that she made
up her mind, at last, to try and bewitch him;
and the first time she tried was on a fine summer
evening, when the royal party was riding
home from the hunt.</p>

<p>It had been an exceedingly dull hunt that
day, for the King had found nothing whatever
to kill, and this made him so exceedingly irritable
that his followers took care to keep a
good way behind him as they rode along.
That was how it happened that the King was
riding quite alone, when a voice suddenly
called out to him from the side of the road.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, King!" said the voice.
"Have you had good sport to-day?"</p>

<p>The King pulled up his horse and looked
round; and when he saw a wonderful-looking
girl all dressed in green, sitting at the foot of
an old lime-tree, he did not know quite what
to say. He knew very little about girls, for
he had spent all his life in killing things, but
he had a sort of idea that the girl in green was
not much like the princesses who came to
court.</p>

<p>"I have had no sport at all," he said at last.
"All the animals were hiding to-day."</p>

<p>"No doubt they were," said the Green En<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>chantress.
"So would you be, if people came
hunting you with great horrid spears and
things!"</p>

<p>She was really laughing at him, but the
King had no idea of it. He only looked at
her more solemnly than before.</p>

<p>"What do you know about it?" he asked
her.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I know more about this forest
than you know about the whole of your kingdom,"
answered the Green Enchantress; and
this time she laughed outright. But the King
did not mind in the least.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you do," he said simply. "I
never pretended to know much. I do not
even know why you are laughing. Will you
tell me?"</p>

<p>"I am laughing because you know so little,"
she answered mysteriously, "and because there
is so much I could tell you if it pleased me."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you could," replied the
King. "Will it please you to tell me now?"</p>

<p>"I don't feel inclined to tell you now," said
the Green Enchantress.</p>

<p>"How strange!" exclaimed the King. "If
I had anything to tell, I should tell it at once;
but then, I am not a girl. When will you tell
me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Next time you come," laughed the girl in
green.</p>

<p>"Next time?" said the King. "Why should
I come twice when once would do?"</p>

<p>She did not trouble to answer that at all;
and when the King looked again at the old
lime-tree, the girl in green had completely
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Is there a witch in the forest?" he asked,
when his followers came riding up to him.</p>

<p>"There is the Green Enchantress, your
Majesty," answered the chief huntsman. "I
have never seen her, but they say she is the
most beautiful woman in the whole world."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the King, in surprise; and
he went home and spent the whole of the
evening in trying to remember what the girl
in green had looked like. He had quite forgotten,
however; so the very next morning
he stole out of the palace long before any one
was awake, and walked as fast as he could in
the direction of the old lime-tree. The wild boars
and the other animals were most surprised
to see him there so early in the day, and they
followed him in twos and threes to see what
he was going to do. As for the King, he
strode on over the dewy grass and never
noticed them at all. And all the while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
bracken on either side of him was alive with
trembling little rabbits, all squeaking to one
another, with their hearts in their mouths,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We shall certainly be killed if the King
sees us!"</p>

<p>At last he came to the old lime-tree at the
side of the road; and there sat the wonderful
girl all dressed in green, with her dark red hair
falling round her down to the ground. The
King would have taken off his crown to her, if
he had not come out without it; but he made
her a low bow instead, and the Green Enchantress
began to laugh.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" she said, "why have you come
back again?"</p>

<p>"They told me you were the most beautiful
woman in the world, so I came to see if it was
true," said the King.</p>

<p>"And now you are here, do you think it is
true?" asked the girl in green.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said the King, doubtfully;
"but I don't know much about girls. If you
were a wild boar, now, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I'm not a wild boar!" cried the Green
Enchantress; and she was so angry at being
compared to a wild boar that she promptly
threw a spell over the King and tried to turn
<i>him</i> into a wild boar. But the King went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
being a king, just the same as before, and he
had no idea that he was expected to be a wild
boar at that very moment.</p>

<p>"When are you going to tell me all the
things you know?" he asked her, smiling.</p>

<p>"I have forgotten what there was to tell,"
said the Green Enchantress, sulkily; and she
got up and walked away among the trees.
The King wondered what he had done to
offend her, and he tried hard to remember
whether he had ever offended any of the princesses
who came to court; but as none of the
princesses who came to court ever thought of
showing their feelings, he would not have
known if he had.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Green Enchantress was feeling
very cross indeed. "What is the use of
being an enchantress if people refuse to be
enchanted?" she grumbled; and she ran off
as fast as she could to find her godfather, the
magician Smilax, for nothing ever put her into
such a good temper as a visit to her godfather.
Now, Smilax was the most amiable magician
the world has ever contained, and he lived in
an ordinary little cottage with a green door
and a white doorstep and a red chimney-pot,
and he did not look like a magician at all.
All the same, Smilax was by no means a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
stupid magician, as the rest of the story will
show.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" he asked, when his
godchild ran in at the door. "Do you want
me to teach you a new spell?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" cried the Green Enchantress.
"I am tired of spells; I want something much
better."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the kind old magician,
"let us hear what it is all about, and then
we'll see what we can do."</p>

<p>It was impossible to go on being cross when
any one was as good-tempered as Smilax; so
his godchild climbed at once on to the arm of
his chair, and sat there with her little white feet
dangling, while she told him all about the King
who would not turn into a wild boar. "Is it
not hard," pouted the Green Enchantress,
"that I cannot bewitch the King?"</p>

<p>"Some kings are easier to bewitch than
others," remarked the magician, wisely.
"Now, what is it you want me to do for
you?"</p>

<p>"I want you to make me into a princess,"
said his godchild, promptly. "Then I can go
to court and dance with the King! Only think
of it!" And she pretended that the poker was
the King and danced round the room with it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to show how she should behave when she got
to court.</p>

<p>"That's easily done," said Smilax. "You
shall go to court and dance with the King, if
you like; and I will make you so fine a princess
that the King will not be able to distinguish
you from all the other princesses in the
palace!"</p>

<p>"But I don't want to be like all the other
princesses, godfather; I want to be a <i>real</i>
princess," objected the Green Enchantress.</p>

<p>Smilax shook his head. "Then I cannot
help you," he said. "Nobody can make a
real princess,&mdash;not even the Fairy Queen herself.
Real princesses make themselves, and
that is a very different matter."</p>

<p>"Shall I never go to court, then?" asked his
godchild, with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Of course you shall!" said Smilax. "Can
you not go to court without being a princess?
There is a back door to the palace as well as
a front one, and any ordinary person can get
in at the back door. But you must give up
all your witchcraft the moment you set foot in
the palace, for it is impossible to be an ordinary
person and a bewitching one at the same
moment."</p>

<p>"I don't mind that," said his godchild. "If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
I cannot bewitch the King I do not want to
be an enchantress any more. I will go to the
palace this very minute!"</p>

<p>And so she did, and that was how it came
about that there was a new scullery-maid at
the palace; and, one fine morning, the King
met her all among the vegetables, as he took
his stroll in the garden after breakfast. It is
extremely probable that the King would not
have noticed her at all if she had not happened
to be wearing a bright green handkerchief
tied over her dark red hair. He
felt sure that he had seen that bright green
and that dark red somewhere before, so he
stopped and looked at her.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" he asked her, with
a smile.</p>

<p>"I am picking beans for the King's dinner,"
answered the little scullery-maid.</p>

<p>"How extremely kind of you!" exclaimed
the King, who had always supposed that
the beans for his dinner picked themselves.
"Will you let me look at them?"</p>

<p>She held out her basket, and the King
peeped inside and found it full of bright
scarlet flowers.</p>

<p>"Are those beans?" asked the King in
wonderment, and he thought he had never
seen anything so charming before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"I <i>hope</i> so," said the little scullery-maid with
an anxious sigh, for she knew no more about
it than the King and was dreadfully afraid
of being scolded for picking the wrong thing.
Indeed, she had hardly finished speaking when
the angry voice of the chief cook called her
from the back door; and away she scampered
down the garden path.</p>

<p>Every one noticed how absent-minded the
King was at dinner, that day. He talked even
less than usual, and when the fifteenth course
came round he turned reproachfully to the
Prime Minister.</p>

<p>"I thought I was going to have beans for
dinner," observed the King, in a disappointed
tone.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty has just helped himself to
beans," said the Prime Minister, when he had
recovered from his surprise at the King's
remark.</p>

<p>"What?" exclaimed the King, looking at
his plate. "Are these the beautiful scarlet
beans that grow in my kitchen-garden? Impossible!"</p>

<p>"They turn green when they are cooked,
your Majesty," said the Prime Minister, who
had never seen a bean growing in his life but
could not possibly have owned such a thing
before the court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then let me have my beans before they
are cooked, in future," said the King; and the
Prime Minister hastily made a note of it on
his clean cuff.</p>

<p>There was a magnificent ball at the palace
that evening, and the King had ninety-nine
delightful princesses to dance with, but none
of them had dark red hair, and when he
had finished dancing with the ninety-ninth he
once more turned reproachfully to the Prime
Minister.</p>

<p>"Where is the hundredth Princess?" he
demanded impatiently.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister knew no more about
the hundredth Princess than he had known
about beans, and he wished he had gone to
bed instead of coming to the court ball to be
worried by the King's questions. He was
too sleepy, however, to invent any more answers,
so he had to tell the truth; and no doubt
he would have made a much better Prime
Minister if he had always been too sleepy to
invent things that were not true, but that, of
course, has nothing to do with the story.</p>

<p>"I have never heard of the hundredth Princess,
your Majesty," he said wearily. "Would
it please your Majesty to tell me what she is
like?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>He fully expected the King to be exceedingly
angry, and he wondered whether he
should be beheaded at once or only imprisoned
in one of the King's dungeons. It was therefore
a great surprise to him when the King
burst out laughing and was not in the least
offended.</p>

<p>"I never heard of her myself until this
morning," said the King. "She has wonderful
dark red hair, and she is so sweet and so
kind that she actually picks the vegetables for
my dinner!"</p>

<p>The Prime Minister was so relieved at not
being put into a dungeon that he positively
yawned in the King's presence; and the King,
for the first time in his life, noticed that he
looked tired and sent him home to bed, which
was certainly a much nicer place to send him
to than a dungeon. And as for the Prime
Minister, he went on speaking the truth to
the end of his days.</p>

<p>The next morning, the King hastened into
his garden the moment he had swallowed his
breakfast. The chief huntsman met him just
as he was leaving the palace, and asked him
what time it would please him to start for the
hunt.</p>

<p>"Hunt?" cried the King, impatiently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
"What hunt? I am going to pick the vegetables
for my dinner, and that is ever so
much more important!" And he ran down
the steps and across the lawn, as never a
King ran before.</p>

<p>The little scullery-maid was wandering
among the gooseberry bushes with a very
disconsolate look on her face. "I am looking
for sage to stuff the King's ducks with,"
she said, when the King came hurrying towards
her; "but I don't know a bit what it
is like, and how can I be expected to pick
things when I don't know what to pick?"</p>

<p>"Do not look so distressed," said the King,
for her eyes were full of tears. "I am the
King, and I do not mind whether my ducks
are stuffed or not."</p>

<p>"Ah, but the chief cook does," said the little
scullery-maid, who, of course, had known all
the while that he was the King. "The chief
cook will beat me if I do not fill my basket
with sage. Look! this is where he beat me
yesterday for bringing the wrong beans."</p>

<p>She rolled up her sleeve and showed him a
tiny black speck on her dainty white arm. To
be sure, it was not much of a bruise, but when
one has been an enchantress all one's life it
is a little hard to be beaten for not knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
enough. The King was quite overcome with
distress, and he stooped and kissed the little
black mark tenderly; and that, as every one
knows, is the only way to cure a bruise.</p>

<p>"Come with me," he said, "and I will help
you to find some sage. Then the King's
ducks will be stuffed, and the chief cook will
not be able to beat you."</p>

<p>So the King and the scullery-maid wandered
all over the kitchen-garden and hunted for
sage. And the King knew just as much
about it as the scullery-maid, and the scullery-maid
knew as much as the King, and that
was just exactly nothing at all; so there is
no doubt that the King's ducks would never
have got stuffed that day, if the pair of them
had not suddenly stumbled upon a bush of
rosemary.</p>

<p>"Does it not smell sweet?" exclaimed the
little scullery-maid, and she picked a whole
handful of it and gave it to the King.</p>

<p>"Surely," cried the King, "anything so
charming as this must be the very thing we
are looking for!"</p>

<p>The angry voice of the chief cook sounded
once more from the back door, so they did not
stop to think any more about it but filled the
basket with rosemary as fast as they could;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and then away scampered the little scullery-maid
down the path, while the King stood and
watched the little curls of dark red hair that
fluttered in the breeze.</p>

<p>The chief cook was far too grand a person
to stuff the King's ducks, so he left it to the
little scullery-maid; and the result was that
the King's ducks were stuffed with rosemary.
There were only two people in the palace who
enjoyed their dinner that day: one was the
King, who sat at the head of the royal table
and had three helpings of roast duck; and the
other was the little scullery-maid, who sat on
the back doorstep and ate the scrapings of all
the plates out of a big brown bowl. As for
the courtiers, they never forgot that dinner as
long as they lived; but this was not surprising,
for ducks that are stuffed with rosemary
are surely ducks to be remembered.</p>

<p>After that, the courtiers had to eat a good
many nasty things for dinner. Every day the
chief cook sent the little scullery-maid into the
garden to pick something for the King's dinner,
and every day the King came and helped
her to find it; and although they never found
the right thing and although it was generally
very nasty, the King always ate three helpings
of it, and that was all that mattered to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
chief cook. To be sure, it was a lot of trouble
to take, just to please the chief cook, and it
would have been far simpler to have cut off
his head then and there; but neither the King
nor the scullery-maid thought of that. After
all, it was much nicer to go on meeting each
other among the gooseberry bushes, and it certainly
saved the expense of an execution.</p>

<p>Before long people began to wonder what
had come over the King. He never went near
the royal forest, and when he was not in the
kitchen-garden he was in the library, looking
for books that would tell him the difference
between a banana and a turnip and the best
place to find a cauliflower. The chief huntsman
and all the other huntsmen had never
been so dull in their lives; but the wild boars
and all the other animals were as happy as
the day was long. Even the rabbits began to
pop up their heads above the bracken, and
were quite amazed when they found that no
one was waiting to kill them. "Truly," they
squeaked to one another, "the Green Enchantress
must have bewitched the King after all!"
And perhaps they were not far wrong.</p>

<p>Now, the same thing cannot go on for ever;
and one morning, when the King hastened out
into the garden as usual, the scullery-maid saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
at once that he had something important to
say.</p>

<p>"There is to be a ball to-morrow," he told
her. "The Prime Minister says so! And
there will be ninety-nine princesses there besides
yourself."</p>

<p>The little scullery-maid shook her head. "I
shall not be there," she said. "I am only a
scullery-maid; and no one, not even the Fairy
Queen, can make me into a real princess."</p>

<p>"You are the hundredth Princess," declared
the King; "and no one, not even the
Fairy Queen, can make you into a scullery-maid."</p>

<p>"The ninety-nine other princesses have never
picked the vegetables for the King's dinner,"
sighed the little scullery-maid.</p>

<p>"They would never do anything half so
sweet nor so kind," said the King.</p>

<p>"The ninety-nine other princesses," continued
the little scullery-maid, looking down at
her crumpled print gown, "have never worn
such an old frock as mine!"</p>

<p>"Nor have they ever looked half so beautiful
or so charming," said the King.</p>

<p>The angry voice of the chief cook sounded
loudly from the back door, and the little scullery-maid
turned to run down the path as usual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
But, this time, the King caught her by the
hand and held her back.</p>

<p>"Will you come to the ball and dance with
me?" he asked coaxingly.</p>

<p>She looked very sad. "I am not a real
princess, you see," she sighed.</p>

<p>The angry voice of the chief cook sounded
louder than before, and she pulled away her
hand and escaped down the path.</p>

<p>"Will you come to the ball?" the King
shouted after her.</p>

<p>"Perhaps!" laughed the little scullery-maid
over her shoulder, and the next moment she
was out of sight. It was truly a strange way
of accepting an invitation to the King's ball;
but then, she was the hundredth Princess, and
perhaps that made all the difference.</p>

<p>It was a most magnificent ball; and the
hundredth Princess <i>did</i> come to it. For, just
as the King finished dancing with the last of
the ninety-nine princesses, a great hubbub was
heard in the hall outside; and into the room
ran the little scullery-maid, and after her ran
the chief cook with the soup-ladle in his hand,
and after them both came the Prime Minister,
and the chief huntsman, and the Lord High
Executioner, and all the other people who were
in the hall because they did not know how to
dance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are you?" cried the ninety-nine princesses,
as the little scullery-maid stood in front
of them all, in her crumpled print gown, with
her green handkerchief tied over her head.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" echoed all the courtiers
and all the pages who happened to be there.</p>

<p>"She is nothing but a scullery-maid," cried
the chief cook, brandishing his soup-ladle.</p>

<p>"She is the Green Enchantress," gasped the
chief huntsman.</p>

<p>"You are all talking rubbish," said the Prime
Minister, who had certainly lost some of his
manners since he took to speaking the truth.
"Any one can see she is the hundredth
Princess!"</p>

<p>But it was the King who really settled the
matter.</p>

<p>"She is the Queen, of course," he said gently,
and came and took her by the hand. And no
one thought of contradicting him, for, although
real princesses have to make themselves, it
is quite certain that any king can make a
queen.</p>

<p>When the ninety-nine princesses saw how
charming the little Queen was, they crowded
round her with one accord and gave her
ninety-nine kisses. So they were real princesses,
after all! "Tell us," they begged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
her afterwards, "are you really the Green
Enchantress?"</p>

<p>"Oh no," she said; "I gave up being an
enchantress when I found I could not bewitch
the King."</p>

<p>"Why did you want to bewitch me, dearest?"
asked the King, in amazement.</p>

<p>"Because you were so fond of killing things,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Then I will never kill anything again as
long as I live!" vowed the King.</p>

<p>And that is the end of the story, for when
the little rabbits heard that the King had given
up hunting, they all gave a great gulp and
swallowed their hearts. And after that, there
was no one in the kingdom who was not happy,
for everybody's heart was in the right place.</p>

<h2>Somebody Else's Prince</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>




<p>In a country that is so far away that only
wymps and fairies ever live long enough
to get there, an exceptional King and Queen
once ruled over their five children, a devoted
nation, and each other. Now, the five children
had five gardens all in a row; and four of these
belonged to the King's four sons, and were just
as beautiful as gardens cannot help being,
which is surely beautiful enough for ordinary
folk. The Princess Gentianella, however, was
anything but an ordinary princess; and her
garden, the one that came at the end of the
row, was far more beautiful than any one could
possibly describe. This was hardly to be wondered
at, for, while the four Princes had to
work very hard in their gardens before anything
would grow in them, the fairies just
came and breathed on the Princess's garden,
and everything that was bright to see and
sweet to smell grew up in it. Even the wymps
did not play any tricks with the Princess's garden;
for they had given her their warm little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
wympish hearts the moment she was born; so
they allowed the sun to shine on her charming
flower-beds as much as it pleased&mdash;and, of
course, it pleased the sun to shine there very
often indeed.</p>

<p>Now, the Princess's garden was surrounded
by a wall. When she was quite a little girl,
the King and Queen had ordered the wall to
be built, just high enough to keep her from
looking over it; and every time that the Princess
grew a little more, another row of bricks
was added to the wall, so that, by the time she
had stopped growing altogether, the wall was
ever so much higher than she was. She was
such a dainty little Princess, though, that even
then it was not a very high wall. Still, it was
high enough to prevent her from seeing what
was on the other side; and this annoyed her
so much that all the pretty flowers the fairies
could give her did not make up for the things
she was not tall enough to see. The King
and Queen had no idea of this; they loved
their little daughter extremely, and they only
thought how clever and how wise they were to
keep her from looking into the world that lay
outside her garden. "She might see something
to frighten her, if she could see over the
wall," they said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The four Princes had no walls round their
gardens, and what was more, they could see
over the wall of their sister's garden, too; but
they never thought of telling her what they saw.</p>

<p>"Boys always have all the fun," sighed the
little Princess. "I wish I were a boy!"</p>

<p>Then, one by one, the three elder Princes
rode away into the world and left their gardens
to run to seed; and at last the time came for
the King's youngest son to go too.</p>

<p>"It will be dreadfully dull when you have
gone away," said the Princess, who was sitting
on the grass-plot in her garden when Prince
Hyacinth came to say good-bye to her.</p>

<p>"Oh no," answered her brother, with a smile;
"you can still play in your pretty garden."</p>

<p>The Princess pouted. "<i>You</i> would not like
to play by yourself for ever and ever and ever,"
she remarked.</p>

<p>The Prince was sure he would not have liked
it at all, but then, he was not a little girl. "It
must be rather dull," he confessed; "but perhaps,
if you wait long enough, some other
prince will come into your garden, and then
you can ask him to play with you."</p>

<p>The Princess shook her head. "He will
never be able to get in," she sighed. "Only
look at that stupid high wall!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince Hyacinth laughed outright, as princes
sometimes do when their sisters are only little
girls. "I expect he'll be able to get in, if he
is anything of a prince," he observed. Then
he kissed her on both cheeks, and rode away
like the others.</p>

<p>That was how the Princess Gentianella was
left alone in the most beautiful garden on this
side of the sun. And if it had not been for
the wymps, she might never have known to
the end of her days what the world was like
on the other side of her wall. Fortunately for
every one, however, the wymps are never far
off when a charming little princess is in
trouble; and on the very day that the King's
youngest son rode away into the world, one of
the nicest and the naughtiest and the wympiest
wymps of all came head first through the sun,
and was sitting on the top of the Princess's
wall with his legs dangling, before she had
time to say "Oh!"</p>

<p>"Come now," said the wymp, "let's hear all
about it." His tone was so exceedingly
friendly, and he seemed so unlikely to give her
good advice, which was all that a fairy would
have done, that the Princess Gentianella dried
her eyes and told him everything. When
she had finished, the wymp stood on his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to concentrate his thoughts, and reflected
deeply.</p>

<p>"Will <i>you</i> tell me what is on the other side
of my wall?" asked the Princess Gentianella,
as the wymp remained in this remarkable position
without speaking. She did not know that
it never makes much difference to a wymp
whether he is on his head or his heels, so she
was naturally afraid that he would make his
head ache if he stood on it any longer. However,
the wymp came through the air in somersaults,
when he heard the Princess's question, and he
landed in the middle of a bed of scarlet poppies
and twinkled at her.</p>

<p>"You won't like it, if I do," he remarked.</p>

<p>"I am quite positive I shall," declared the
Princess; "and you are such a particularly
nice kind of wymp that you surely cannot
refuse to tell me!"</p>

<p>No wymp of the right sort could have resisted
an appeal like that; and as every wymp
is the right sort of wymp, this particular wymp
at once did as the Princess asked him.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "There isn't much to
tell, though. There are the usual rows of
mountains, and the usual rivers and lakes and
islands and peninsulas and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't!" cried the Princess, stopping up her
ears with her little pink finger-tips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"&mdash;and isthmuses," continued the wymp,
cheerfully; "and volcanoes, and hot springs
and cold springs, and palm-trees and apple-trees
and boot-trees&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't believe," interrupted the Princess,
indignantly, "that there is nothing but a stupid
geography book on the other side of my
wall!"</p>

<p>The wymp looked at her and twinkled more
than ever; but when he saw that her eyes
were shining, just as her own flowers might
have done at the time of the dew-fall, he
stopped teasing her at once. No one knows
better than a wymp when it is time to stop
teasing.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he said. "What is the matter
now?"</p>

<p>"I thought I should see something quite
different," said the Princess, plaintively.</p>

<p>"So you would, my little dear," cried the
wymp. "I was only telling you what <i>I</i> saw.
Give me those two ridiculous little hands of
yours, and you shall see everything that I
didn't."</p>

<p>This time the Princess Gentianella did say
"Oh!" and she said it because she found herself
sitting on the top of her wall, with all the
world on the other side of it lying stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
out before her, for miles and miles and miles.
She did not see very much at first, though, for
she looked no further than the little corner of
it that lay just under her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why," said the Princess, softly, "there is a
garden on the other side of my wall. And
only look, there is a real Prince in the middle
of it!"</p>

<p>She turned round to tell her wymp all about
it, but the wymp had other work to do and
was already on his way to the back of the sun.
So there was nothing for it but to look over
the wall again, and this time the Prince
glanced up and saw her.</p>

<p>Now, Prince Amaryllis had been waiting a
great many days for some one to appear at the
top of the wall, but now that some one really had
appeared there and was looking so extremely
glad to see him, he suddenly found he had
nothing whatever to say to her. That is what
occasionally happens to the most charming of
princes. Fortunately, however, the Princess
knew perfectly well what to say to him.</p>

<p>"I knew there would be something nice on
the other side of my wall," she cried. "The
wymp was quite wrong, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"No doubt he was, if you say so," answered
the Prince, who had never noticed the wymp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
at all. "But how is it, little lady, that you
can see me?"</p>

<p>The Princess opened her big eyes and stared
at him. "How can I help seeing you, if you
are there?" she asked.</p>

<p>"But I'm not here, that's just it," explained
Prince Amaryllis; "at least, I am not supposed
to be. You see, I have been invisible all my
life, and you are the first person, outside my
own country, who has ever been able to see me.
I am very glad you can see me," he added
politely; "one gets a little tired sometimes of
being heard and not seen."</p>

<p>"When I was a little girl," said Princess
Gentianella, drawing herself up to her full
height, "I was always taught to be seen and
not heard. That was very dull, too. But tell
me, why is it that you are invisible?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the Prince. "The whole of
my country is invisible, too. Tell me what you
can see, Princess, from the top of your wall."</p>

<p>"I can see you," answered the little Princess,
promptly.</p>

<p>"But do you see nothing else?" asked Prince
Amaryllis.</p>

<p>The Princess shaded her eyes with her hand
and looked away into the distance. "I can see
a large flat plain, with no trees and no rivers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and no people and no houses," she answered
presently.</p>

<p>Prince Amaryllis sighed. "You are looking
right into my country," he said dolefully, "and
it is every bit as full of trees and rivers and
people and houses as anybody else's country.
Do you not hear anything either?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Princess Gentianella; "I can
hear the murmur of voices and the ripple of
rivers and the rustle of trees. I have heard
those sounds all my life, but I thought they
were in the wind."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort," replied the Prince.
"They are the sounds that belong to my country,
where everybody is heard and not seen. It
all began with a christening-party, a hundred
years ago. My great-grandfather was King
then, and he was the most absent-minded king
that has ever ruled over us, and he forgot to
ask the Witch to dance with him, which, of
course, offended her deeply. And it happened
that she was a witch who was always making
experiments, so she experimented on my country
at once by making it invisible, and it has
been invisible ever since."</p>

<p>"How strange!" said Princess Gentianella.
"I never remember hearing any one talk about
your country."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course not," sighed the Prince; "you
can't expect people to talk about a thing that
isn't there, can you? You have no idea how
stupid it is to live in a place that no one can
see."</p>

<p>"But why does not someone disenchant
your kingdom?" asked the Princess, who
had read quite enough history to know that
kingdoms are always disenchanted sooner or
later.</p>

<p>"That is what I am trying to do," answered
Prince Amaryllis. "The spell can only be removed
if a king's son will spend a whole year
in this waste piece of ground and make it into
a beautiful garden. But although I have been
here nearly a year, I have not been able to
make a single flower grow. It is a little tiresome,"
he added with another sigh, "for it is
part of the spell that I shall have to be executed
if I fail."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed the little Princess.
"You are much too nice to be executed!
Won't you let me come and play in your garden?
Perhaps I might help you to make the
flowers grow."</p>

<p>Prince Amaryllis shook his head and smiled.
"It is not a nice garden to play in," he said.
"I think I will come and play in yours instead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and you shall teach me the way to make the
flowers grow."</p>

<p>So the Prince jumped over the wall into the
Princess's garden, and they walked about, hand
in hand, among all the bright flower-beds that
the fairies had planted there. They did not
play very much, though, for they had so many
things to talk about; and they talked and
talked and talked, without stopping a moment,
for the rest of the afternoon. For all that,
when tea-time came and the Prince went back
into his own garden, he remembered all sorts
of things he might have said to the Princess if
he had only thought of them in time; while
Princess Gentianella, in the middle of her
second cup of tea, also remembered all the
things she might have said to the Prince, only
she had not said them. That is always the
way with princes and princesses who are carefully
brought up.</p>

<p>After that, Princess Gentianella and Prince
Amaryllis played together for a number of
days. But they always played in the Princess's
garden, because it was a much nicer garden
to play in; and as for the Prince's garden, they
seemed to have forgotten that altogether.
Then, one afternoon, when the Princess ran out
as usual into the hot sunshine, her Prince from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
over the wall met her with a very disconsolate
face.</p>

<p>"The year has come to an end," he told her,
"and since I cannot make the flowers grow in
my garden, I shall have to go and be executed
as soon as the Witch sends for me."</p>

<p>The little Princess's lips began to quiver,
and her eyes grew large and round and shining.
"It is too bad," she declared, "to execute a
really nice Prince like you!"</p>

<p>"Do not be distressed," replied Prince
Amaryllis, in a resigned tone. "Now that I
have seen you, little lady, I shall be almost glad
to be executed."</p>

<p>"You are talking nonsense," declared the
Princess. "Why do you want to be executed?"</p>

<p>"Because, even if I knew the way to make
the flowers grow," he replied, "my country
would not be disenchanted unless I married
Anemone, the Witch's daughter, as well. And,
of course, I would sooner be executed than do
that!"</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the Princess; "you have
promised to marry a witch's daughter? Do
you mean to say that all this while I have
been playing with somebody else's Prince?"</p>

<p>There was no doubt that the Princess Gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>tianella
was extremely angry; and the Prince
could not help thinking that she was just a
little bit unreasonable as well.</p>

<p>"You see, it was part of the disenchantment,"
he explained. "If <i>you</i> had to be invisible
all your life, you would promise anything
to get disenchanted. Besides," he added, as
the Princess showed no signs of being appeased,
"they told me that Anemone, although a
witch's daughter, was exceedingly beautiful."</p>

<p>"What difference does that make?" demanded
the Princess. "You ought to have
told me before, that you were somebody else's
Prince. You haven't been playing fair!"</p>

<p>"It is true I forgot to mention it," said the
Prince, a little crossly; "but one cannot remember
everything, you know."</p>

<p>Princess Gentianella gathered up her train
with much dignity and turned her back on the
Prince.</p>

<p>"People who are as forgetful as that deserve
to be invisible," she observed haughtily;
and with that she swept up the garden path
and into the palace. She lost all her dignity,
however, as soon as she was out of the Prince's
sight; and it was a very doleful little Princess
who came to take tea with her royal parents
that afternoon. When she even went so far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to say that she preferred bread-and-butter to
plum-cake, the King and Queen began to be
seriously alarmed.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with the child?" asked
the Queen of the King.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she has a sunstroke," suggested
the King, who thought that only illness could
possibly prevent a daughter of his from eating
her plum-cake at tea-time. The Queen knew
better, but she waited until the King had
gone back into his study before she said anything.
Then she said the very best thing
possible.</p>

<p>"What did you see when you looked over
your wall, little daughter?" she asked.</p>

<p>"There was a prince on the other side,"
confessed the Princess Gentianella.</p>

<p>"To be sure, there was," smiled the Queen.
"There is always a prince on the other side;
but why should that make you unhappy? Is
he not a nice prince?"</p>

<p>"He is a <i>real</i> Prince," said her little
daughter; "and I should not be at all unhappy
if he had not just told me that he is somebody
else's Prince!"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the Queen, consolingly;
"you will soon find another prince in your
garden."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 459px;">
<img src="images/col04-tn.jpg" width="459" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"But not <i>that</i> Prince," wept the poor little
Princess.</p>

<p>"One prince is much the same as another,"
said the Queen; but she did not think so for a
moment, and no more did the little Princess.</p>

<p>Now, it was quite true that Prince Amaryllis
had not been playing fair, and that his forgetfulness
was enough to annoy the nicest little
Princess in the world; but for all that, he
was going to be executed, and it is difficult to
be angry for long with anyone who is just
going to be executed. So, when Princess Gentianella
ran out once more into the sunshine
on the following morning, she was fully prepared
to make friends with her Prince from
over the wall. She was greatly disturbed to
find, however, that there was no one to make
friends with; and although she called the
Prince's name several times, not an answer
came from the other side of the wall. Then
the Princess Gentianella did what she had
never been brave enough to do before,&mdash;she
shut her eyes and jumped; and either she
jumped higher than so small a princess ever
jumped before, or else the wall was not nearly
such a high wall as she had always thought it
was, for the next moment she found herself on
her two little feet in the very middle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Prince's garden. She was very close to the
invisible country now, and the people's voices
were so loud that she could actually hear what
they were saying. This was not really surprising,
though, for they were all saying the
same thing.</p>

<p>"Our Prince cannot make the flowers grow,
and the Witch has taken him away to be executed,"
was what they were saying.</p>

<p>When the Princess Gentianella heard that,
she dropped straight down on the ground and
burst into tears, and her tears rained all over
the garden in showers; and wherever they fell,
the flowers began to grow,&mdash;first of all, snowdrops
and primroses and daffodils, then red
poppies and blue larkspurs and white lilies,
then hollyhocks and nasturtiums and mignonette,
and last of all, roses,&mdash;red roses, pink
roses, yellow roses, all sorts of roses. And the
scent from all these flowers was so delicious
that the little Princess lifted her head at last
and looked round.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, starting to her feet; "some
one <i>has</i> made the flowers grow in the Prince's
garden!"</p>

<p>"Some one certainly has," chuckled a voice
from the top of the wall; and there sat the same
wymp as before, looking just as though he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
never gone away to the back of the sun at all.
At the same instant, the people's voices sounded
louder than ever from the kingdom close by.</p>

<p>"The flowers have learned the way to grow
in the Prince's garden," they were shouting;
"and the Prince will not be executed, after
all!"</p>

<p>Princess Gentianella danced for joy, in and
out of the Prince's bright flower-beds. "The
Prince will not be executed, after all," she said,
too.</p>

<p>"And he will be able to marry Anemone, the
Witch's beautiful daughter," added the wymp.</p>

<p>All the laughter died out of Princess Gentianella's
face, and she looked up at the wymp
in a very woe-begone manner indeed.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said piteously, "I never thought
of that. I&mdash;I had quite forgotten that he was
somebody else's Prince."</p>

<p>The wymp fairly wimpled when he saw
the poor little Princess looking so unhappy.
"Don't you fret about that, my little dear,"
he cried. "Do you suppose the Witch's daughter
wants anybody else's Prince, either?"</p>

<p>Princess Gentianella clapped her hands with
delight. "Of course she doesn't!" she cried.
"But perhaps she does not know he is somebody
else's Prince."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then go and tell her so," suggested the
wymp; and before she had time to thank him
for his advice he had gone off once more to
the back of the sun.</p>

<p>The little Princess did not stop to think
about it, but just ran as fast as she could
towards the invisible kingdom of Prince Amaryllis.
It might seem a little difficult to run
towards a place that did not appear to be there,
but to any one who was in as great a hurry as
the little Princess a thing like that was of very
small consequence. So she ran and she ran
and she ran, until the Prince's kingdom was
really obliged to stop being invisible, for in
all the hundred years that it had been bewitched
no one had ever tried so hard to see it before.
Besides, it would have been most impolite of
anybody's kingdom to go on pretending that
it was not there, when the Princess was so determined
to pretend that it was; so in the end
she suddenly found herself in the middle of a
country that was as full of trees and rivers and
people and houses as any other country, and
the particular part of it in which she found
herself was a nice green field full of woolly
sheep.</p>

<p>"What a charming kingdom!" exclaimed
Princess Gentianella. "How green the trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
are, and how fresh everything looks! Why,
there is not a speck of dust to be seen."</p>

<p>"Of course there isn't," answered a jolly
little lamb, who was trying, as lambs will, to
behave as though he had only two legs instead
of four. "Dust, indeed! When a kingdom
has not been seen for a hundred years, naturally
it keeps fresher than a kingdom that any
one can stare at. Nothing fades a kingdom
like staring at it, you know. However, all this
will soon be altered, for I hear that the Prince
has made the flowers grow in his garden; so
all he has to do now is to marry the Witch's
daughter, and then we shall be disenchanted
at last."</p>

<p>"Oh no, you won't!" said Princess Gentianella,
shaking her finger at him wisely.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the lamb, standing still
for the first time in his life.</p>

<p>"Because the Prince is <i>not</i> going to marry
the Witch's daughter," answered Princess Gentianella;
and she ran on before the lamb had
time to recover from his astonishment.</p>

<p>Down a curly white road ran the little
Princess, between two of the greenest hedges
she had ever seen, until she came to a stile.
Now, she had never climbed a stile in her life,
so of course she did not know what to do next.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
However, there stood the stile waiting to be
climbed, and there stood the Princess feeling
very much inclined to cry, when it happened
most fortunately that an old woodcutter came
strolling along. He was a particularly cross-looking
woodcutter, but the Princess was in
far too great a hurry to notice that.</p>

<p>"If you please," she said as politely as she
could, "will you lift me over this great, big,
high stile?"</p>

<p>The woodcutter at once did as he was asked,
and then was so surprised at his own kindness
that he stood and stared at the little
Princess.</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" he exclaimed. "That's
the first time in my life I ever did anything to
please anybody. Are you a witch?"</p>

<p>"No, but I am looking for one," said Princess
Gentianella. "Can you tell me where
she is?"</p>

<p>"If you mean the one whose daughter is going
to marry the Prince, I think I can," replied
the woodcutter, who thought he might as well
go on being kind, now that he had once begun.</p>

<p>"That is certainly not the witch I mean,"
answered the Princess, promptly, "for the
Prince is <i>not</i> going to marry any witch's
daughter!" And she ran on faster than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently she came to a brook that was
covered with ice.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" cried Princess Gentianella. "It
was springtime round the corner, and here have
I tumbled into the middle of winter!"</p>

<p>A fish popped his head through the ice, and
laughed from ear to ear,&mdash;two things that he
could do quite easily, for he happened to be a
skate. "The seasons have been mixed up in
this country ever since we were bewitched, a
hundred years ago," he said. "It is no use
being particular about the time of year when
there is no one to see what kind of weather
you are having. If you stand on tiptoe you
will see summer going on in the next field."</p>

<p>"It must be very difficult to know what
clothes to put on, when you take a walk in this
country," remarked the Princess. "But, of
course, it doesn't matter what you do wear
when there is no one to look at you!"</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the skate, "things will
soon be altered, and the seasons will have to
right themselves again, for I am told that
Prince Amaryllis is going to marry the Witch's
daughter, and so the country will be disenchanted
at last."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" laughed the little Princess,
knowingly. "Don't you believe everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
you are told! The Prince is going to do
nothing of the sort!"</p>

<p>Then she ran away from the skate and the
frozen brook, and she ran right out of winter
into the middle of summer; and she might
have gone on running until she reached the
middle of autumn too, if she had not been
stopped by an enormous sea-serpent who was
lying stretched across the road. When the
sea-serpent saw the Princess, of course he
flapped his fifty-five fins at her, and lashed his
tail about furiously, and growled in a hoarse,
fishy voice. But the Princess mistook his fury
for politeness. When one has lived in a garden
with a wall round it and never seen a sea-serpent
in one's life, one is apt to make these
mistakes.</p>

<p>"I am very pleased to meet you," she said,
with her most charming smile; "I have often
wanted to meet a dragon."</p>

<p>"She calls me a dragon!" groaned the sea-serpent,
foaming like the sea in a tempest;
"and I am connected with the very best family
of sea-serpents! What will people say next?"</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," said the Princess, humbly.
"You see, I thought, as you were not in
the sea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was expecting that," interrupted the sea-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>serpent,
bitterly. "No one ever will believe
in me unless I stop in the sea. It is very
depressing!"</p>

<p>"I am sure I am very glad you have come
out of the sea," said the Princess, politely,
"because it has given me the pleasure of meeting
you. But does it not make you very thirsty
to lie in this hot dusty road?"</p>

<p>"Not nearly so thirsty as stopping in the sea
and having nothing but salt water to drink,"
answered the sea-serpent. "People do not
realise what a thirsty life a sea-serpent has to
lead. If they did," he added severely, "they
would not stand in front of him and ask so
many questions!"</p>

<p>The Princess laughed merrily. "I do not
want to stand here at all," she explained; "but
unless you move your tail a little on one side,
I really cannot get past."</p>

<p>"If you do get past," growled the sea-serpent,
"you will fall into the Witch's hands."</p>

<p>"That is exactly where I want to fall!" cried
Princess Gentianella; "only you must move
your tail a little bit more than that, or else I
am afraid I shall step on it."</p>

<p>It was such a novelty for the sea-serpent to
find some one who was not frightened of him,
that he had not the heart to tell her that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
was just going to eat her up. So he moved
his tail out of the way, and Princess Gentianella
blew a kiss to him from the tips of her
little pink fingers and ran on as before.</p>

<p>The next person she met was an old woman,
who was picking thistles in a field.</p>

<p>"I wonder why you are doing that!" said
the Princess, opening her big blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I am making an experiment, to see if I can
find any one with so brave a heart that the
thistles will not be able to hurt it," answered
the old woman, mysteriously.</p>

<p>"But does it not scratch your fingers to
gather those large prickly thistles?" asked the
little Princess.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it does," the old woman said
shortly; "but who do you suppose is going to
gather them for me?"</p>

<p>She seemed rather cross, but the Princess
supposed it was because she had pricked her
fingers so much.</p>

<p>"Well, I am in a most tremendous hurry,
but I think I can stop and help you," she answered;
and down she dropped on her knees
and began to pick thistles as fast as she could.
And when the thistles saw what soft pink fingers
were going to take hold of them, they at
once bent back all their prickles and allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the Princess to gather as many as she pleased
without giving her so much as a scratch.
When she had filled the old woman's apron for
her, she began to run off at full speed, to make
up for lost time. But the old woman called
her back.</p>

<p>"Stop!" she cried. "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I am going to find the Witch's daughter,"
answered Princess Gentianella, looking back
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said the old woman. "May
I ask what you want with her?"</p>

<p>"I want to tell her not to marry Prince
Amaryllis, because he is not her Prince but
somebody else's Prince," said Princess Gentianella.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said the old woman again.
"And whose Prince may he be, then?"</p>

<p>"He is my Prince, of course!" answered the
little Princess, laughing happily; and then
away she ran across the field, and into the
wood that lay beyond.</p>

<p>In the wood, under a hazel-tree, sat a tall
and beautiful girl, weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, oh dear!" said Princess Gentianella,
mournfully. "How dreadfully sorry I
am!"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the girl, looking up at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because you are crying, to be sure," answered
the Princess. "Will you tell me why
you are so sad?"</p>

<p>"My mother, who is always making experiments,
wants me to marry a Prince I have
never seen, just to see how we should like
it," explained the girl. "And all the while, I
am somebody else's Princess!"</p>

<p>"That is very strange," remarked Princess
Gentianella. "Now <i>I</i> am sad because my
Prince has got to marry Anemone, the Witch's
beautiful daughter, and I am trying to find her
to tell her that he is really my Prince. Do you
think she will want to marry him, when she
hears that he is somebody else's Prince?"</p>

<p>The beautiful girl suddenly sprang to her
feet and began to laugh joyfully. "I am
sure she will not," she answered, "for <i>I</i> am
Anemone, the Witch's daughter. So nobody
will have to marry anybody's Prince except her
own, and the witch will not be able to make
experiments any more!"</p>

<p>"That is settled, then," said the little Princess,
contentedly. "Now let us go and find our
Princes. But supposing that I find your Prince
first, how shall I know that he <i>is</i> your Prince?"</p>

<p>"His name is Hyacinth," answered the
Witch's daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"How delightful!" cried Princess Gentianella,
clapping her hands. "Then I shall find
my youngest brother as well as my Prince.
But do you know where they are?"</p>

<p>Anemone, the Witch's daughter, began to
look a little doubtful. "I have just remembered,"
she confessed, "that I sent Hyacinth
to kill your Prince, only a few minutes before
you came along. Do not be anxious, however,"
she added hastily, "for perhaps he will not be
able to find him."</p>

<p>The Princess Gentianella was not at all
anxious. "Nobody could possibly be strong
enough to kill my Prince," she observed; "and
as for Hyacinth, he will be quite safe, for Prince
Amaryllis is much too nice to hurt any one!"</p>

<p>She proved to be right, for in another minute
they saw the two Princes coming towards
them arm in arm. And if this should seem
extraordinary, it must be remembered that it
all took place in an enchanted wood, where a
witch had been making experiments for hundreds
and hundreds of years.</p>

<p>"There was no necessity to kill him, dearest,"
cried Prince Hyacinth, "for he is somebody
else's Prince."</p>

<p>He held out his arms as he spoke, and into
them ran Anemone, the Witch's daughter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of course there is no need to tell into whose
arms the little Princess ran. After that, there
was nothing to be heard in the wood except
kissing, until the Witch suddenly stepped on
the scenes.</p>

<p>"Cobwebs and broomsticks! What is the
meaning of this?" she cried furiously.</p>

<p>Three of them turned round and faced her
in an extremely nervous manner; for, after all,
a witch is a witch, and they knew fast enough
that she could turn them into any shape she
pleased. The Princess Gentianella did not
seem nervous, however.</p>

<p>"Why, you are the nice old lady I met in
the field," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I believe I am," said the Witch, who had
never been called a nice old lady in her life
before, and was not quite sure how to take it.</p>

<p>"I have found my Prince, you see," continued
the little Princess, smiling away as happily
as possible.</p>

<p>"So it seems," said the Witch. She was
afraid to say more than that, in case the Princess
should find out who she was, and she
thought she would like to be a nice old lady a
little longer first.</p>

<p>"And have you found any one yet who has
so brave a heart that the thistles cannot hurt
it?" asked Princess Gentianella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I have," said the Witch.</p>

<p>"Then we have all found what we want,"
smiled Princess Gentianella, "and the Witch
cannot surely be so unkind as to refuse to disenchant
the kingdom, just because her daughter
doesn't want to marry my Prince! Do you
think she can?"</p>

<p>The Witch dropped her thistles and held
out her hands to the eager Princess. "My
dear little girl," she said, "the kingdom was
disenchanted the moment you came into it.
As for the Witch, there is no Witch any
longer, for she retired into private life as a nice
old lady, just ten minutes ago. Now, as you
all seem to have sorted yourselves the right
way, the best thing you can do is to go off
home as fast as you can."</p>

<p>No doubt that is where Anemone must have
gone with her Prince, for when the little Princess
looked round and found herself standing
once more in her own garden, there was no one
with her except Prince Amaryllis.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i> may I come and play in your garden?"
asked Princess Gentianella, softly.</p>

<p>The Prince still shook his head. "I have a
much better idea than that," he said; "we will
pull down the wall and make it all into one
garden."</p>

<h2>The Tears of Princess Prunella</h2>





<p>There is no doubt that the Princess
Prunella would have been the most
charming little girl on either side of the sun,
if she had not been so exceedingly cross and
discontented. She was as pretty as any one
could wish to see, and as accomplished as all
the gifts of Fairyland could make her; and
she had every bit of happiness that the love of
her parents and the wit of her fairy godmother
could put in her way. And yet she grumbled
and grumbled and grumbled!</p>

<p>"Can you not try to be happy, just for five
minutes?" asked the Queen, in despair.</p>

<p>"How can you expect me to be happy, even
for five minutes, when every five minutes is
exactly like the last five minutes?" sighed the
little Princess.</p>

<p>"It is tea-time, your Highness," said the
head nurse, coaxingly, "and there are pink
sugar cakes for tea!"</p>

<p>"There were pink sugar cakes yesterday,"
pouted the Princess. "There are always pink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
sugar cakes unless there are white sugar cakes,
and I am equally tired of them both. Can you
not tell me something new?"</p>

<p>"Let her go without her tea," said the King,
who was rather tired of having such a cross
little daughter. But the Queen only smiled.</p>

<p>"The child wants a change," she remarked.
"It must be very dull to play alone all day."</p>

<p>"Dull!" exclaimed the King. "Why should
it be dull? Has not her godmother given her
such wonderful toys that they can play with
her as well as be played with?" This was
quite true, for the very ball that the Princess
threw to the other end of the nursery could
catch itself and throw itself back to her; and
it is not every ball that can do that. "What
more can the child want?" demanded the King,
crossly.</p>

<p>The Queen, however, thought there might
be something more. "We must find her a
playfellow," she said wisely.</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense!" protested the King.
"Why should we bring any more crying children
into the palace? However, you must do
as you like, I suppose."</p>

<p>The King always told the Queen to do as
she liked when he was tired of the conversation;
so the Queen smiled again and issued a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
proclamation at once, to tell the whole world
that the Princess Prunella wanted some one to
play with, and would be ready to choose a playfellow
that day week, at twelve o'clock in the
morning. Now, it is not often that one gets a
chance of playing with a King's daughter, so
it is no wonder that, when the Princess followed
her royal parents into the great hall on
the appointed day, she found it filled from end
to end with all the little princes and princesses
and all the little counts and countesses and all
the little dukes and duchesses that the surrounding
kingdoms could produce.</p>

<p>"I never had a more excellent idea," said
the Queen, as she seated herself on the throne
and looked down at the crowd of children.
"Prunella has talked of nothing else for a
whole week, and she has not been heard to
grumble once."</p>

<p>"That's all very well," observed the King, a
little uneasily; "but it is quite clear that she
cannot play with them all, and who knows that so
much disappointment will not lead to a war?"</p>

<p>The Queen did not answer but turned to her
little daughter, who stood by her side. "Do
not be in a hurry," she said to her. "So many
faces are confusing at first, and you might regret
it afterwards if you made a mistake."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>But Princess Prunella showed no signs of
being in a hurry. She just glanced over the
sea of faces that were turned towards her, and
then looked speechlessly at her mother. The
smiles had all gone from her face, and the big
blue eyes were filled with tears.</p>

<p>"Why, they are all exactly alike!" she said
piteously. "I cannot tell one from another."
And to the astonishment of every one in the
room, she dropped down on the steps of the
throne and began to cry.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear! What is to be done?" exclaimed
the Queen, in much alarm. "It will
look so very bad if all the children have to be
sent home again!"</p>

<p>"It will certainly lead to a war," was all the
King said; and then they both looked helplessly
at their sobbing little daughter. As for all
the children, they were so surprised at hearing
how much alike they were that they said nothing
at all; and it is difficult to tell what would
have been the end of the matter, if the Princess
had not suddenly jumped to her feet again and
pointed towards the door.</p>

<p>"There is the Prince I should like to play
with," she exclaimed. "<i>He</i> is not like the
others, for he has a wonderful look on his
face."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Everybody looked round at the doorway;
and, sure enough, there stood a boy whom no
one had noticed before. "Come here, Prince,"
commanded the Princess, raising her voice
haughtily; "you may kiss my hand if you
like."</p>

<p>But the boy drew back with a bewildered air
and shook his head. Princess Prunella stamped
her foot angrily.</p>

<p>"How dare you hesitate when I tell you to
come here?" she cried. At this, however, the
strange boy turned and hastened out of the
room altogether; and a loud murmur of astonishment
rose from the children.</p>

<p>The King's daughter had never been disobeyed
in her life before, and for a moment she
was too astonished to speak.</p>

<p>"Who is he? What is his name?" she demanded
at last.</p>

<p>There was a pause, broken presently by the
shrill voice of one of the pages. "Please, your
Highness, it is only deaf Robert, the minstrel's
son," he said.</p>

<p>"Deaf!" repeated the Princess. "What is
that?"</p>

<p>"It means that he cannot hear anything,
little daughter," explained the Queen; "so, you
see, he would not do for a playfellow at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Besides, he is not even a Prince. Can you not
choose one of these others instead?"</p>

<p>The Princess, however, could do nothing of
the kind. "All these are alike," she said again;
"but the minstrel's son has a wonderful look
on his face, and I will have no one else for a
playfellow!"</p>

<p>So all the children went sadly back to their
homes, and wondered why they were so much
alike; and the whole court was made uncomfortable
once more by the sulkiness of Princess
Prunella.</p>

<p>"Your Highness's best wax doll has not been
out for two whole days," suggested the head
nurse.</p>

<p>The Princess snatched the doll from her
hands and threw it on the floor.</p>

<p>"If you will not let me play with a boy who
is deaf, how can you expect me to play with a
<i>doll</i>?" she asked; and although, no doubt,
there was much in what she said, it was hardly
the way in which to speak to the head nurse.
Indeed, there would have been a serious disturbance
in the royal nursery the very next
minute, if the Princess's cream-coloured pony
had not suddenly trotted round from the stable
of its own accord, and put it into her head to
go for a ride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, the Princess's pony was of course a
fairy pony; so when he ran away with her in
the forest, that day, it was not to be supposed
that he would run away with her for nothing.
He took her, in fact, for a real fairy ride, all
through a fairy forest, that began by being
quite a baby forest and then grew and grew,
the deeper she went into it, until it ended in
being quite a grown-up forest. And the pony
never stopped running away until he reached a
dear little grey house, that was set in the
brightest of flower gardens, right in the middle
of the forest.</p>

<p>The Princess slipped off his back and pushed
open the little gate and walked into the flower
garden. Any one else might have been surprised
to find deaf Robert sitting there, in the
middle of the trim green lawn, but after a fairy
ride one is never surprised at anything; so the
Princess's heart just gave one big jump for
joy, and she ran straight up to him and took
his hand.</p>

<p>"Poor deaf boy! poor deaf boy!" she said
softly. Certainly she was not behaving like a
King's daughter, for she ought to have been
extremely angry with him for disobeying her
in the morning, instead of which she spoke as
gently to him as any ordinary little girl might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
have done. But then, as he could not hear
what she said to him, what was the use of
speaking like a princess?</p>

<p>"Poor deaf boy!" she repeated, bending over
him; "no wonder you look so dull and unhappy!"</p>

<p>It was the first time in her life that she had
forgotten she was a princess, and she was
quite surprised at the gentleness of her own
voice. She was still more surprised when the
deaf boy rose to his feet and bowed very low
and answered her.</p>

<p>"I was only unhappy, Princess, because I
could not hear what you said to me this morning,"
he explained.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the Princess. "You <i>can</i> hear
me now!"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said deaf Robert; "I can hear
you now, because you speak so kindly. It is
only when people are angry and speak roughly
that I cannot hear them. That is why they
say I am deaf."</p>

<p>"Have you always been deaf?" asked the
Princess, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Ever since the wymps came to my christening,"
answered the minstrel's son. "For
when they asked my father what gift he
would choose for me, he chose that I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
be deaf to every sound that was not beautiful."</p>

<p>"So that is why you have such a wonderful
look on your face," said Princess Prunella.
"I wish the wymps went to everybody's christening!"</p>

<p>Deaf Robert shook his head. "If they had
not come to mine," he remarked, "I should
have been able to hear what you said to me
this morning."</p>

<p>"Never mind!" said the Princess. "Come
back to the palace with me now; I will never
speak crossly to you again, and then you will
always be able to hear what I say."</p>

<p>"No, no," answered Robert, shrinking back.
"I cannot come to the town; it is so silent
there, it frightens me."</p>

<p>"Silent?" echoed the Princess. "Surely, it
is the forest that is silent!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the minstrel's son, smiling;
"the forest is full of sound. Can you not hear
them all talking,&mdash;the bees and the flowers
and the great pine-trees?"</p>

<p>Princess Prunella listened. "No," she said,
shaking her head, "I can hear nothing." Then
she took the deaf boy's hands and pulled him
towards the gate. "Come back to the town
with me," she said eagerly. "It is true that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
you cannot hear the other people's voices; but
you will always be able to hear <i>me</i>, and that is
ever so much more important!"</p>

<p>So the minstrel's son went back to the
palace with Princess Prunella; and when the
King and Queen saw how happy their little
daughter was at last, they said nothing more
about deaf Robert not being a prince, but got
over the difficulty by making him a Marquis
on the spot and giving him the appointment
of Playfellow-in-chief to her Royal Highness.
A magnificent banquet was given to celebrate
this important event, at which several speeches
were made by the King and several tunes were
played by the band; but as the speeches were
exceedingly pompous and the tunes were exceedingly
noisy, the new Marquis, for whom
they were intended, heard neither one nor
the other. However, he heard every word
that the little Princess whispered in his ear,
and perhaps that was all that he wished to
hear.</p>

<p>Never had life passed so peacefully at the
palace as in the days that followed. The
Princess was never heard to utter an angry
word, and she went about with a contented
look on her face that cheered the hearts of all
who knew her. It was indeed a happy day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
for the court when the minstrel's son came to
play with the King's daughter, and every one
rejoiced that the King and the Queen had been
wise enough to let their little daughter have
her own way. But all this while no one
thought of the minstrel's son.</p>

<p>Now, anybody might suppose that a minstrel's
son, who suddenly found himself made
into a Marquis and Playfellow-in-chief to a
Princess, would be the happiest boy in the
world. And yet, although he grew fonder
every day of his little playfellow, deaf Robert
was the saddest person in the whole court. He
grew more and more silent as the days went
on, until at last even the Princess noticed that
he was changed.</p>

<p>"The wonderful look has gone from your
face," she said to him. "Can it be that you
do not feel happy at court?"</p>

<p>Then the boy-Marquis told her the truth.
"I am unhappy because I cannot hear the
sounds of the town," he said. "Will not your
father go and live in the forest for a change,
so that we can play there together, instead of
in this horrible, silent place?"</p>

<p>"But I don't want to go and play in the
forest," objected the Princess. "There are no
people in the forest; and I should forget I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
was a person myself, if I had nothing to talk
to but the flowers and the trees."</p>

<p>For the first time since they had played together,
deaf Robert remembered that he was
nearly two years older than the little Princess;
and he smiled in a superior manner.
"That is only because you hear all the wrong
things," he said. "If you could once hear the
sounds of the forest, you would never want to
come back to the town."</p>

<p>The Princess turned red with anger, and
she opened her mouth to give the minstrel's
son a thorough good scolding, which would
certainly have surprised him had he been able
to hear it. But she remembered in time that
he would not be able to hear it, so she sighed
impatiently and answered him as softly as she
could.</p>

<p>"You are quite mistaken," she said, putting
her chin in the air. "If you were a real boy
you would understand." And with that she
turned and left him. It was certainly annoying
not to be able to lose her temper whenever
she felt inclined, but there was nothing to prevent
her from remembering that she was a
princess.</p>

<p>That afternoon, the Princess pricked her
finger, and the minstrel's son found out that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
what she had said was quite true, and he was
not a real boy at all. For, of course, the Princess
did what any other little girl of twelve
years old would have done, and burst into
tears; while the minstrel's son, who was quite
unable to hear her sobs, only stared at her
solemnly, and wondered why her pretty round
face had suddenly twisted itself into such a
strange expression.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Prunella?" he asked
her gravely.</p>

<p>"Doing!" wept the Princess. "Why, I am
crying, of course! That is what you would
be doing if you had pricked your finger as
badly as I have." She held out her small
white finger as she spoke, but the minstrel's
son only stared at her as solemnly as before.</p>

<p>"Crying? What is that?" he asked. "And
why should you do anything so useless?
Surely, it would be better to fetch a doctor or
a piece of sticking-plaster."</p>

<p>Princess Prunella came to the end of her
patience. It had been bad enough to exist for
six whole weeks without being allowed to lose
her temper once, but now that she found she
could not even cry with any pleasure, she felt
it was more than any little girl of twelve years
old could be expected to bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"It isn't sticking-plaster that I want," she
said miserably. "When people cry, they want
to be comforted, of course."</p>

<p>"Do they?" said deaf Robert, looking perplexed.
"But if I cannot hear you cry, how
am I to comfort you?"</p>

<p>The Princess was far too cross to be reasonable,
though she managed to remember that it
was no use letting her crossness appear in her
voice. "That's just it!" she sobbed. "You
ought to be able to hear me cry, and then you
would be a real boy!"</p>

<p>And the Princess pitied herself so much for
being forced to play with some one who was
not real, that she buried her face in her hands
and wept more than ever. She half hoped,
even then, that deaf Robert would come and
kiss her and make friends again, as any nice
boy would have done at once; but deaf Robert
did nothing of the kind, and when she at last
took her hands from her eyes, her playfellow
was gone.</p>

<p>Truly, the forest had never looked so beautiful
as on that day when the minstrel's son
hastened through it on his way to his old
home. The flowers looked their best, and
the birds sang their merriest, and the trees
bent their greenest boughs, to give him a wel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>come;
but the boy with the wonderful look on
his face, who had lived among them for so long,
never paused so much as to glance at them,
and they only had time to notice, as he passed
them by, that the wonderful look was no longer
there. On he hurried until he came to the
little grey house, set in its garden of bright-coloured
flowers; and he pushed open the gate
and walked in, just as his Princess had done
six weeks ago.</p>

<p>The minstrel was at home, this time, and he
was sitting on the doorstep in the sunshine.
He had just composed a new song, and that
always made him extremely happy; but he
sighed a little when he saw his son come in at
the gate, for he, too, had no difficulty in seeing
that the wonderful look had gone from the
boy's face.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, my son?" he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>Deaf Robert wasted no time in greeting
him. "Father," he cried, "why did you ask
the wymps to my christening?"</p>

<p>"That is easily answered," said the minstrel,
soothingly. "It was because I wished you to
hear nothing but beautiful sounds all your life."</p>

<p>"But what sounds do you call beautiful?"
demanded his son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The minstrel smiled. "Can you not hear
my music?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said deaf Robert; "but what
else?"</p>

<p>It had never struck the minstrel that there
need be anything else, and he hesitated a little.
"Well," he said at last, "can you not hear the
sounds of the forest?"</p>

<p>Deaf Robert looked up at the pine-trees overhead
and down to the flowers at his feet. "I
used to be able to," he said sadly, "but even
the forest has grown silent now." Then he
clenched his fists and looked imploringly at his
father. "Must I live to the end of my days
without hearing any of the things that other
boys hear?" he cried.</p>

<p>"You are a little unreasonable, my son," said
the minstrel. "Are not the beautiful sounds
of life enough for you?"</p>

<p>"Enough?" said deaf Robert. "I want
much, much more than that, father. Why, I
want to hear the Princess cry!"</p>

<p>"That is nonsense!" exclaimed the minstrel.
"Tears make a most unpleasant sound, and
you would be extremely disappointed if you
were to hear the Princess cry."</p>

<p>The minstrel's son drew himself up proudly.
"You do not understand; you are not real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
either," he said. "The tears of <i>my</i> Princess
make the sweetest sound in the world, and I
am not going to rest until I learn how to hear
it." Then he turned and walked through the
gate and out into the forest once more.</p>

<p>The minstrel looked after him and sighed.
"It was the best gift I could think of," he
murmured; "it was the one I would have
chosen for myself. It is true," he added thoughtfully,
"that I never wanted to play with a
King's daughter."</p>

<p>The minstrel's son wandered aimlessly
through the forest,&mdash;the forest that he had
once liked so well because it was all his, and
that he only liked now because he had found
his little Princess in it; and there he might
have been wandering still, if he had not suddenly
met a wymp. This was not really surprising
in that particular forest, for it was just
the kind of forest in which any boy of fourteen
might at any minute meet a wymp; but for all
that, deaf Robert was just a little bit startled
when the wymp suddenly dropped in his path
from the tree above and nodded at him.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said the wymp. "What is the
matter with you?"</p>

<p>"I am very unhappy, because I am not a
real boy," explained deaf Robert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear me! How is that?" asked the
wymp, pretending to be surprised.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>you</i> ought to know," answered deaf
Robert. "It is all because the wymps came to
my christening."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort!" cried the wymp,
indignantly. "It is all because your father
insisted on knowing better than we did, and
we let him have his own way. If the wymps
had not been at your christening, you would
not even <i>want</i> to be a real boy. So you cannot
hear the Princess cry, eh? That's a good
wympish joke, that is!" And the wymp stood
on his head and choked with laughter.</p>

<p>"It is all very well for you to laugh," complained
the minstrel's son. "You don't know
how unpleasant it is to be a boy without being
a real boy."</p>

<p>The wymp came down on his toes again and
stopped laughing. "Then why don't you go
and learn to be a real boy?" he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"How can I find out the way?" asked deaf
Robert.</p>

<p>"You ridiculous boy!" exclaimed the wymp.
"Why, the first person you meet will be able
to tell you that!"</p>

<p>Deaf Robert had no time to thank him for
his information, for the wymp began turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
somersaults the moment he had finished speaking,
and he went on turning them until he
turned into nothing at all, and there was no
more wymp to be seen. Then the minstrel's
son walked on through the forest; and for
three days and three nights he met no one at
all, but on the morning of the fourth day he
came to the very edge of the forest, and there
he saw an old woman sitting by the side of a
blackberry bush.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried deaf Robert, waving his
cap. "Do you know that you are the first
person I have met, and that you are going to
tell me how to become a real boy?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you at once," said the old woman,
smiling, "for you come straight to the point
and do not beat about the bush. This is what
you must do, then:&mdash;something brave and
something kind and something foolish and
something wise. If you are not a real boy
after that, it will be your own fault!" Then
she walked round the blackberry bush and disappeared;
and although deaf Robert forgot
what she had just said about him and beat
about that bush in good earnest, he never saw
any more of her.</p>

<p>Then the minstrel's son walked straight on
in search of a brave deed to do; and this did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
not take him long, for there are always plenty
of brave deeds waiting to be done by some one.
So, long before the sun was above his head
that day, he came to a castle where a beautiful
Princess was being kept captive by a cruel old
giant,&mdash;all because he was cruel, and for no
other reason at all. And when deaf Robert
saw the Princess weeping behind the bars of
her prison window, he was reminded of his
own little Princess whom he had left weeping
on the nursery floor; and that made him call
on the giant instantly to come out and be
killed. The giant laughed a great laugh and
came out into the courtyard, not to be killed,
but to kill the minstrel's son instead; but before
he had time to do that, the minstrel's son
had managed to kill <i>him</i>, and there was an
end of the cruel old giant.</p>

<p>"That is the bravest deed I have ever seen
done!" cried the Princess, when he fetched
her out of her dungeon.</p>

<p>"Brave deeds are easily done, then," said
deaf Robert; but he was glad enough, all the
same, to hear that he had done the first part of
his task. The next thing he did was to take
the beautiful Princess back to her own country;
and that seemed to him a great waste of
time, for he could not certainly do his kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
deed so long as he had the Princess on his
hands. But when they reached her country
and the Princess told her father how deaf Robert
had come out of his way to bring her home,
the old King was pleased, and asked him what
reward he would like for his trouble. "For,"
he said, "you have done the kindest deed any
one could possibly think of."</p>

<p>"No reward for me!" laughed deaf Robert;
"for there is my kind deed done without my
knowing it!" And off he set once more on
his travels.</p>

<p>After that, the minstrel's son wandered about
for a great many days; for neither a wise nor
a foolish deed could he find to do. Sometimes,
when he thought he had been wise, the people
told him he was cruel, and drove him out of
their country; and sometimes, when he was
sure he had been foolish, they only praised
him for his kindness. He grew tired and footsore,
and his clothes became old and ragged,
and he almost forgot that he had once been a
Marquis and Playfellow-in-chief to a princess.
But he never forgot how the little Princess
Prunella had looked, as she sat on the nursery
floor and wept with sobs that he was not able
to hear. So two years passed away, and still
he had not learned how to be a real boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, as he walked along a country
road, he came upon a girl driving cows.</p>

<p>"Why are you looking so sad?" she asked
him.</p>

<p>"Because I left my Princess crying in her
nursery two years ago, and I have been away
from her ever since," answered the boy, simply.</p>

<p>The girl burst out laughing. "Well," she
exclaimed, "that was a foolish thing to do!"</p>

<p>"Foolish?" shouted deaf Robert. "Did you
say <i>foolish</i>?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I did," laughed the girl. "Could
anything be more foolish than to keep away
from some one whom you want to be with?"</p>

<p>"Then I will go back to her this very instant,"
declared the minstrel's son.</p>

<p>"And that would be the wisest thing you
could do," answered the girl; and she immediately
disappeared, cows and all, which just
shows that she must have been a wymp all the
while.</p>

<p>"Well," said deaf Robert, "there are my
wise and my foolish deeds done together, and
now I am a real boy!"</p>

<p>Then off he set homewards as fast as he
could go; and although it had taken him two
years to come away from home, it only took
him two hours to get back again, so it is clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
that the wymps must have had a hand in that,
too. And just about tea-time he stood outside
the nursery door in the palace of his own
little Princess.</p>

<p>It is well to remember that the wymps had
come to the christening of the minstrel's son;
otherwise it might seem a little wonderful that
the Princess Prunella should have pricked her
finger again, on the very day that her Playfellow-in-chief
came back to her. Anyhow,
that is what had happened; and as the minstrel's
son stood outside the door and listened,
he heard the softest and the sweetest and the
prettiest sound he had ever heard in his life.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" he cried. "At last I can hear
the Princess cry!" And he burst open the
door and ran into the room, all in his rags and
his tatters, and knelt down to comfort the
King's daughter.</p>

<p>"Only look at my finger," wept Princess
Prunella, as she showed him her little hand.
Truly, it was impossible to tell which of her
small white fingers the Princess had pricked,
but as the minstrel's son kissed every one of
them in turn, it is clear that he must have
healed the right one; and that, of course, was
why the Princess stopped crying at once.</p>

<p>Then she looked at her old playfellow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
laughed for joy to see him there again. "The
wonderful look has come back into your face,"
she said, "but it is ever so much more wonderful
than before!"</p>

<p>"Dear little playfellow," whispered the minstrel's
son, "I can hear the forest sounds again,
too; but you were right all the time, and the
sounds of the town are much more charming
than the sounds of the forest."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," declared the Princess. "There
you are quite mistaken, for the sounds of the
forest are more beautiful by far."</p>

<p>And it is a fact that they have been disputing
the point ever since.</p>

<h2>The Palace on the Floor</h2>






<p>Prince Picotee had just built a fairy
palace on the nursery floor, and he sat
back on his heels and looked at it with pride.
Surely, no one had ever built so fine a palace
before in the space of thirteen minutes and a
half! Not only were there two lofty towers
that soared proudly upwards until they were
actually as tall as the Prince himself, but there
was a great arched doorway as well, with a
flight of steps leading down from it away under
the nursery table; and there was even a
drawbridge, made of a single big brick and
suspended by a piece of string. All this, however,
might be found in anybody's palace;
what made the Prince's palace different from
every one else's was just the way the windows
were built. They were not built in rows,
like ordinary windows, so that any one could
guess how dull and square the rooms were
inside; but they appeared here and there as if
by accident, sometimes at a corner, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
on the top of another window, sometimes under
the battlements, wherever, in fact, the little
builder-Prince had felt inclined to put a window;
and the most wonderful thing of all was
that, however much he tried to peep through
them, he could not possibly see what the rooms
were like beyond. So the palace he had built
himself was full of beautiful halls and rooms
and passages that no one would ever be able
to see.</p>

<p>"No doubt," exclaimed Prince Picotee, "this
is the most wonderful palace that ever was
built!"</p>

<p>Just then Dimples, the Prime Minister's
little daughter, ran into the room. "How absurd!"
she cried. "Why, it isn't a real palace
at all!"</p>

<p>"It is real enough for me," said Prince Picotee.
"When I am grown up and a king, I
shall have a palace exactly like this to live
in."</p>

<p>Dimples came and sat on the floor by the
Prince. "<i>I</i> shouldn't like to live in a palace
that would tumble down directly you pulled
out the bottom brick," she observed, placing
her fat little finger on the brick as she spoke.</p>

<p>The Prince seized her hand hastily. "There
will be no girls in my palace," he said with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
dignity; "it is only girls who want to pull
down other people's palaces."</p>

<p>Dimples put her head on one side and examined
the palace afresh. "How untidy your
steps are!" she remarked. "The top one is
shorter than the others, and there is a join in
the middle of the second one."</p>

<p>The Prince felt a little hurt. "It is not my
fault if the bricks are not all the same length,"
he said. "Besides, those things do not matter.
Only look at my beautiful windows!"</p>

<p>Dimples looked, and burst out laughing.
"What funny windows!" she exclaimed.
"Why, you can't see into the rooms! What
is the use of having a palace when you don't
know what it is like inside?"</p>

<p>"You don't understand," answered Prince
Picotee. "Anybody can see inside an ordinary
palace; this is a particular palace, you see."</p>

<p>Dimples did not see at all; so she changed
the conversation. "What are all those soldiers
doing on the table?" she asked.</p>

<p>"They are not on the table," explained the
Prince. "They have been marching since yesterday
morning, and they are on the road to
my fairy palace." He then began to station
his soldiers on the battlements of the two lofty
towers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose you think your wooden soldiers
are real, too!" laughed the Prime Minister's
daughter.</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered the Prince. "If you
speak so loud, they will hear you, and it would
never do for them to know that you called them
wooden. <i>Anything</i> might happen to you if
you made them really angry!"</p>

<p>"You are only talking nonsense," said Dimples,
which was what she always said when
she did not understand what the Prince meant.
At the same time she could not help being
struck by the look on the face of the soldier
that Prince Picotee had just picked up. It was
the captain of the little regiment; and as the
Prince placed him at the post of danger on the
bottom brick of all, she felt sure that she saw
a flush of anger on his painted wooden cheeks
and a gleam of mischief in his round black
eyes. "He is only a toy soldier," said Dimples,
tossing her head; but she did not say it aloud,
and it is certain that she felt a little uncomfortable,
all the rest of that day, about the look
on the captain's face.</p>

<p>Now, Dimples had come to stay with the
Prince for a few days, and it happened that the
room in which she slept was next to the royal
nursery; and right in the middle of the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>&mdash;which,
as every one knows, is the time for
wymps and fairies to be about&mdash;she awoke suddenly
with a most unpleasant start. There, by
the side of her bed, stood one of the Prince's
wooden soldiers, shouldering his wooden gun
as though he had never done anything else for
the whole of his life,&mdash;which was certainly the
truth,&mdash;and holding himself just for all the
world as though he were glued together. He
was certainly a most military-looking soldier,
and if Dimples had not been a particularly
brave little girl, she might have been decidedly
frightened.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" she asked, sitting up
and rubbing her eyes.</p>

<p>"Follow me. Prince's palace. Captain's
orders," said the little soldier, in three jerks;
and he turned round and marched stiffly
towards the door. His tone was hard; but
then, of course, his voice, like everything else
about him, was made of wood. Dimples made
no fuss about obeying him, for she was always
ready for an adventure; so out of bed she
jumped without any more ado, and followed
him into the next room. It took them several
minutes to get there, because the soldier
walked so very slowly; but this, again,
was not surprising, for people with wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
legs cannot be expected to walk as fast as
ordinary folk.</p>

<p>When they reached the nursery, Dimples
gave a cry of surprise. It was evident that
the Prince's palace had sprung upwards since
the afternoon, for the two towers were now far
above her head, while as for the drawbridge,
by the time she had crossed it and mounted
the magnificent flight of steps, she found herself
quite out of breath. "Perhaps it is a real
palace, after all," she said doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Don't mutter. Bad manners. Captain's
prisoner," said the soldier in three jerks, as
before.</p>

<p>Dimples did not answer, for at that moment
she stepped inside the Prince's palace and was
too breathless with excitement to utter a word.
It was indeed no ordinary hall in which she
found herself; it was built entirely of oak
beams of different lengths, so that in one place
the ceiling was low and in another place it was
high, in one corner there were several doors,
and in another there were several windows;
here an arch tottered perilously over an opening,
and there a solitary pillar blocked up the
whole of a doorway. It was truly a wonderful
palace, as the Prince had said, but it was a
little surprising at first sight. Dimples, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>ever,
had no time to think about it, for at that
moment a stern voice was heard coming from
below the floor of the hall.</p>

<p>"Bring the prisoner here!" said the voice.
Dimples looked through a hole in the floor,&mdash;which
was not difficult, as the floor was full of
holes,&mdash;and there, on the bottom brick of all,
stood the toy captain.</p>

<p>"Come along. Bottom brick. Captain waiting,"
said her guide; and with some little difficulty&mdash;for
it is not easy to jump from beam
to beam when one is accustomed to solid floors&mdash;she
scrambled after him and arrived in front
of the terrible captain.</p>

<p>"Oho!" said the captain, grasping his sword
as tightly as he could,&mdash;which was very tight,
as it happened, because his fingers were glued to
it,&mdash;"who is the real person now, you or I?"</p>

<p>The question was a puzzling one, but Dimples
did her best to answer it truthfully.
"Well," she said, "I suppose you are real,
though I didn't think so before; and I suppose
I am real, too; but it is rather confusing,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Not at all confusing," said the captain, a
little rudely it must be owned. "It is quite
clear that I am real, of course; but as for you&mdash;why,
you are not even painted!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Dimples, as politely as she could,
"I am not painted, and I don't think I want to
be painted, thank you. Why, I should never
feel safe for a moment if I had a face that
anybody could wash off with a sponge!"</p>

<p>At this the toy captain was so furious that
he shook with anger from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said, "that I have only
to pull out the brick on which I am standing,
and the whole palace will tumble down on
your head?"</p>

<p>"Of course I know," laughed Dimples, who
was growing less frightened every minute;
"but if you do, it will tumble down on your
head as well as mine."</p>

<p>"That is true," said the toy captain, "but I
am a real person and I am made of wood, so it
will make no difference to me."</p>

<p>Dimples was obliged to own that there was
something in what the captain said; and as she
disliked nothing so much as being beaten in
an argument, she at once pretended not to be
listening.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, how hungry I am!" she said,
yawning.</p>

<p>"If you were real and not made up," said
the toy captain, "you would never get hungry
at all." However, he called out to a soldier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
who was mounting guard on the top of a pillar
just over his head, and ordered him to bring
the prisoner some food. In a few minutes,
Dimples found herself in front of a curious
meal, served on round cardboard dishes and
consisting of one red jelly, two raw mutton
chops, a bunch of grapes, and a slice of
salmon.</p>

<p>"But they won't come off the dishes, will
they?" asked Dimples, who had fed her dolls
for years on the very things that were now
placed before her.</p>

<p>"Of course not," said the toy captain. "They
would have been lost long ago if they had not
been stuck on. What more can you want? If
you were a real person, as you pretend to be,
your appetite would be taken away by the mere
sight of dishes like those!"</p>

<p>This, in fact, was what had already happened
to Dimples, for there was nothing very enticing
about a jelly from which she remembered
sucking the paint only a week ago; while as
for the other things, even her youngest and
favourite doll was beginning to grow tired
of their monotony. So she made no objection
when the captain ordered the dishes to be
removed.</p>

<p>"Now you have satisfied your hunger," con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>tinued
the captain, "I will order you to be
taken upstairs to the dungeon."</p>

<p>"Upstairs!" exclaimed Dimples. "What a
funny place for a dungeon!"</p>

<p>"Funny? Not in the least!" said the captain,
severely. "In a palace of this kind you
must take the rooms as you find them. You
will find the dungeon squeezed between the
drawing-room and the kitchen, at the very top
of the left-hand tower. There you will have
to stop until the King comes."</p>

<p>"Who is the King?" asked Dimples, curiously.</p>

<p>Before the toy captain had time to answer,
the band of the regiment struck up an inspiriting
march. To be sure, there were only two
wooden drummer boys and two wooden trumpeters,
of whom one had lost his trumpet and
was therefore obliged to blow continually
through his stiffened fingers; but for all that
they made quite a cheerful noise, and in the
middle of it the King mounted the steps and
entered the palace.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! The King! It is the King!"
shouted the whole regiment in twenty wooden
voices.</p>

<p>"The King!" repeated Dimples. "Why, it
is the Prince!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense," said the captain,
gruffly. "Do you suppose we would allow
ourselves to be commanded by a mere Prince?
This is a real King, I can tell you, though he
isn't made of wood, more's the pity!"</p>

<p>And when Dimples saw the dignified way
in which the little King walked into the palace,
she could not help agreeing that he was
a very real King. Indeed, she found it difficult
to believe that he was nothing but her
playfellow, the Prince Picotee, for never before
had she seen him look so happy and so
triumphant. There was no doubt that the little
King had found his kingdom; and Dimples,
remembering that she was really his prisoner,
began to wish that she had not teased him so
much about his toy palace and his toy soldiers.
But the King did not even see her; he walked
straight into the great hall and then stood still
and drew a long breath of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"It is the most wonderful palace that ever
was built," he murmured to himself; "it is
much, much more wonderful than I thought."</p>

<p>Then his eyes fell upon Dimples, who was
trying to hide behind the stiff figure of the toy
captain, on the bottom brick of all.</p>

<p>"What is that girl doing in my palace?"
asked the King, frowning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please your Majesty, it is your Majesty's
prisoner," answered the captain,&mdash;"she is
waiting for your Majesty to decide on her
punishment."</p>

<p>"What has the prisoner done?" asked the
King in as dignified a manner as he could
assume, considering that he stood on a tottering
brick at the edge of the abyss in which the
captain and his prisoner awaited him.</p>

<p>"Please your Majesty, she was heard to say
that your Majesty's army was not a real army,
and that I, your Majesty,&mdash;<i>I</i> was nothing but a
toy soldier!" said the captain; and he again
shook with anger from head to foot, which,
after all, was the only way he could shake,
because he was made all in one piece.</p>

<p>"Send the prisoner here," commanded the
King. "It is not safe to keep a prisoner on
the bottom brick&mdash;especially when she is a
girl."</p>

<p>So Dimples, wishing from the bottom of
her heart that the little playfellow she had
teased had not been suddenly changed into a
king, clambered up again into the hall.</p>

<p>"Prince Picotee," she said in an anxious
undertone, as soon as she was near him, "I do
think it is a real palace now, I do really!"</p>

<p>"Why, it's only Dimples!" exclaimed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
King, and he nearly tumbled off the edge of the
floor in his surprise. Then he remembered
that he was a king, and tried to become dignified
again, which, of course, was exceedingly
difficult now that the Prime Minister's daughter
was there to see. As for Dimples, she had
not played with the Prince all her life for nothing,
and she quite ceased to be frightened of
him as soon as she came face to face with him.</p>

<p>"If you let that nasty captain punish me,
I'll tell them all you are only a little boy and
not a king at all," she whispered; and her
round little face twinkled with merriment.</p>

<p>The King wavered. "I always said I would
have no girls in my palace," he murmured
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"Will you promise?" persisted Dimples.</p>

<p>The King avoided her eyes. It was very
hard not to give in and smile too, when
Dimples looked like that. After all, he reflected,
if Dimples was a girl and did not
understand things properly, she made an excellent
playfellow; and the most wonderful palace
in the world might grow a little dull if there
were only wooden soldiers to share it with.
So the King made up his mind, and took the
prisoner by one hand and waved his other in a
royal manner to the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will talk it over with the prisoner," he
announced, "so do not let us be disturbed.
And you need not take any more prisoners
without consulting me," he added hastily, for
he really feared that his nurse might be the
next prisoner, and then, where would be the
fun of being a king at all?</p>

<p>"Now, let us go and explore your palace,"
said Dimples, impatiently; and the captain
was left on the bottom brick to get over his
disappointment.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to describe how the
two children wandered over the fairy palace
that the Prince had built; how they climbed
from one floor to another; how they dropped
from arch to pillar; how they wound their way
in and out of delightful passages, finding fresh
secret rooms as they went; how from one window
they looked down on the vast nursery
tableland and from another caught a glimpse
of the towering rocking-horse; how they quite
forgot they were King and prisoner, and stood
at last, hand in hand, on the battlements of
the highest tower and told each other what
fun it was to play in a real fairy palace.</p>

<p>The toy captain, however, had not forgotten
anything; and when he saw them talking
in this familiar manner on the battlements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>&mdash;which
he could easily do from his position on
the bottom brick, so cleverly was this wonderful
palace built&mdash;he felt it was high time to
interfere.</p>

<p>"Has your Majesty decided how to punish
the prisoner?" asked the toy captain, holding
himself in his very stiffest manner and raising
his voice sufficiently to be heard on the
battlements.</p>

<p>The King looked at the prisoner, and the
prisoner laughed at the King.</p>

<p>"Well," said Dimples, demurely, "<i>has</i> your
Majesty made up his mind?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>don't</i>!" whispered his Majesty, crossly.
"You know I can't behave like a king if you
laugh at me!" Then he folded his arms and
looked down at the captain. "I have decided
not to punish the prisoner at all," he said
solemnly.</p>

<p>"What!" cried the captain, furiously. "You
are not going to punish the prisoner at all?"</p>

<p>"No," said his Majesty, growing bolder;
"and what is more, I am going to have you
beheaded for interfering in the King's private
affairs!"</p>

<p>Even Dimples felt a little nervous when she
saw the look that crept over the captain's face.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," she whispered to the Prince, "that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
is how he looked yesterday when I said he
wasn't real. Would it not be wiser to make
friends with him?"</p>

<p>But her little playfellow was looking as he
had looked when he first entered his palace.
"A king," he said grandly, "makes neither
friends nor enemies. The captain is only my
toy, and I can do as I will with him."</p>

<p>The captain's fury knew no bounds when he
overheard this. "That is what comes of having
a king who is not made of wood," he said.
"But you have forgotten one thing, your
Majesty!"</p>

<p>"And what is that?" asked the King, smiling.</p>

<p>"The bottom brick," said the toy captain, as
he stooped and pulled it out.</p>

<p>Truly, there had never been such a shatter
and a clatter and a tumble as when the toy
captain pulled out the bottom brick of the
Prince's palace! And in the midst of it all the
children felt themselves falling and falling and
falling. And louder than it all sounded the
mocking laughter of the toy captain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Some people would say it was only a
dream," observed Prince Picotee, the next
morning, as they stood over the ruins on the
nursery floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"It can't have been a dream," answered
Dimples, who was always practical, "because
here is the head of the toy captain."</p>

<p>"And here," added the Prince, bending down,
"is his body. So he <i>was</i> beheaded after all!"</p>

<p>"I wish," sighed Dimples, "that it could all
come over again."</p>

<p>"It will some day," the Prince assured her,
"when I am King and have built another
palace like this one."</p>

<p>"But I shall not be there," pouted Dimples,
"because you won't have any girls in your
palace."</p>

<p>Prince Picotee kicked the headless captain
about the floor thoughtfully. "Well, I'm not
quite sure," he said, growing a little red.
"Perhaps I'll have one girl."</p>

<p>"Will you?" laughed Dimples. "But what
if she pulls down your wonderful palace?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Prince Picotee, gravely, "I shall
not tell her about the bottom brick!"</p>

<h2>The Lady Daffodilia</h2>





<p>No one in the whole kingdom was so idle,
or so careless, or so thoughtless as the
Lady Daffodilia. The only thing she had
done ever since she was born was to grow and
grow and grow, so that, although she was only
twelve years old, she was quite as tall as the
Countess, her mother. In fact, she was tall
enough to be conceited about it, which, of
course, was extremely foolish of her, for she
had certainly had nothing to do with it herself.</p>

<p>"You are a whole year older than I am, but
I am a head taller than you," was what she
said to Prince Brilliant, when he came to play
with her, one day. She was perched on the
garden wall at the time, so she was able to
look down on the little Prince even more than
usual.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the Countess, who was drinking
tea on the lawn. "That is not the way to
speak to a Prince."</p>

<p>Prince Brilliant stuck his chin into the air
and tried to make the most of his height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't care a bit," he said; "I wouldn't
have silly long legs like yours for anything.
It's much better to know things; and only
think of all the things I know that you never
heard of! You couldn't even say the exports
and imports of Fairyland without looking in
the book first; now, could you?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said his Queen-mother, who was
also drinking tea on the lawn. "That is not
the way to speak to a little lady."</p>

<p>The Lady Daffodilia stooped a little, and
smoothed out the creases in her black silk
stockings, just to show that she had not forgotten
how much longer her legs were than the
Prince's. The Prince pretended not to see.</p>

<p>"What you say is very true," then said Daffodilia,
who was always fair, even when she was
most aggravating; "but I am better off than
you, all the same. I can go and look in the
book if I want to know all those tiresome stuffy
things you think such a lot about; but all the
books in the world won't make you so tall as
I am!"</p>

<p>The Prince was much annoyed, for there was
no doubt that the Lady Daffodilia had the best
of the argument. He aimed a most unprincely
kick at a harmless geranium plant, that, like
the Lady Daffodilia, had never done anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
in its life but grow; and he turned very red in
the face.</p>

<p>"You're only a girl," he said; "and girls
think too much of themselves. That's what
my Professor says!"</p>

<p>"If <i>you</i> were a girl," laughed the Lady Daffodilia,
"it would not matter about your being
such a little bit of a thing! Is it not very unpleasant
to be so short, when you are a boy?"</p>

<p>The Prince turned and walked quickly
towards the garden gate. It was true that he
was a prince, and could not therefore be rude
to the Lady Daffodilia; but he was a boy, too,
and if he had stopped another minute he was
quite certain he would have lifted her down
from the wall and given her a good shaking.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she cried after
him, and laughed more than ever when she
saw how cross she had made him.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" echoed the Queen
and the Countess.</p>

<p>Prince Brilliant turned when he reached the
gate, and faced them all with a resolute look
on his small, round face.</p>

<p>"I am going to find out the way to grow
tall," he said. "I shall not come back until I
am as tall as the Lady Daffodilia."</p>

<p>Then he went through the gate and slammed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
it behind him, and marched away down the hot,
dusty road. The Queen and the Countess only
smiled, for they did not suppose he had gone
for good; but the Lady Daffodilia slipped down
from the wall and on to the grass lawn, and
began to weep.</p>

<p>"I have sent away my favourite Prince," she
sobbed, "and I shall never have him to play
with again."</p>

<p>"Do not cry, little daughter," said the Countess,
soothingly; "your Prince will come back
soon."</p>

<p>"You do not know him so well as I do,"
said Daffodilia. "He always means what he
says; and since it is quite certain that nothing
can ever make him as tall as I am, it is quite
certain that he will never come back any more."</p>

<p>It seemed as though her words were likely
to come true, for the Prince had not returned
by bedtime; and, although the King's messengers
rode out that very night and hunted the
whole country up and down for days and weeks
and years, not a trace was ever found of the
little Prince who had gone to learn the way to
grow tall. So the kingdom was left without
an heir to the throne, and the Lady Daffodilia
was left without a playfellow. It was not her
way, however, to sit down and cry about it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
besides which she had found something really
important to do at last.</p>

<p>"If the Prince has gone away to grow as tall
as I am," she said, "<i>I</i> will stay at home and
grow as clever as he is!"</p>

<p>So she shut herself up in the Count's library
with a pile of dusty books, and tried her very
best to learn the exports and imports of Fairyland.
But as fast as she learned one she forgot
the other; and she ended by completely jumbling
them up, which was really a serious matter,
for it is quite evident that the things we
give to Fairyland are not at all the same things
as Fairyland gives to us. And then, long before
the Lady Daffodilia had grown as clever
as the Prince, the people came and clapped her
into prison, "for," they said, "it is your fault
that the heir to the throne is lost." It is true
that they did not put her into a very unpleasant
prison, for it was a nice, comfortable old
castle, in the middle of a green plain; but there
was no one to play with and no one to tease,
so it was most decidedly a prison. Added
to this, the Lady Daffodilia seemed to have
stopped growing at last, for she never grew
another inch after the Prince went away; and
as this robbed her of her only occupation, she
began for the first time in her life to long for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
something to do. And she grew so tired of
looking at the same green plain day after day,
that she determined to make it into a garden
for a change; and the flowers and the shrubs
were so proud of being planted by such dainty,
white hands that they tried their very hardest
to grow up nicely and be a credit to her; and
the result was that the little lady in the castle
soon became known as the most wonderful
gardener in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Now, when Prince Brilliant ran away from
the Lady Daffodilia he found the road so hot
and so dusty that he was obliged to keep near
the hedge at the side; and he had not run very
far before he pushed his head through a very
elegant spider's web. The spider was exceedingly
cross, and grumbled; but the daddy-longlegs
that tumbled out of her web was very
much pleased with himself.</p>

<p>"Well, my little friend," he said to the Prince,
"where are you running so fast, this fine
morning?"</p>

<p>Now, one of the things the Prince had
learned from his Professor was the way to
speak to a daddy-longlegs, so before another
five minutes had passed he had told him the
whole of his trouble. "Do <i>you</i> know the way
to make your legs grow long?" asked the
Prince at the end of his story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said the daddy-longlegs, "that is
certainly one of the things I am generally supposed
to know; but if I show you the way, do
you think you will have patience to do everything
I tell you? It may take a very long
time."</p>

<p>"I can wait years and years and years and
years," said the Prince, in his determined way;
and the daddy-longlegs had the sense to see
that he meant what he said.</p>

<p>"Right you are," he said. "Then jump
straight into that hedge; and the more spiders'
webs you break on the way, the better&mdash;nasty,
choky, stuffy things!"</p>

<p>"What shall I do when I get there?" asked
the Prince.</p>

<p>"Oh, you haven't got to do anything," said
the daddy-longlegs, with a chuckle. "Just
wait there until I come to you."</p>

<p>"All right; but you won't be long, will
you?" said the Prince; and he tucked his
crown under his arm and shut his eyes tight
and jumped straight into the thorny, prickly
hedge.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes, he found himself
in a strange new country, that was all made
of rose-coloured dreams, and filled with rose-coloured
air, and lighted with rose-coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
sunbeams. There were no people or trees or
mountains or rivers to be seen; but before the
little Prince had time to notice this, his mind
was filled with rose-coloured thoughts, and so
he forgot the Lady Daffodilia and his own
crossness and everything that had made him
unhappy when he was in the real world.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Where am I?" he cried.</p>

<p>"You are in the world of dreams, to be sure,"
said a voice in his ear. "Where else should
you be at your time of life?"</p>

<p>"But who lives here?" asked Prince Brilliant.</p>

<p>A great many voices answered him. "<i>We</i>
live here, of course," they said. "We are
really nice dreams, we are; and when children
are the right sort, like yourself, they come here
to stay with us until they are grown up."</p>

<p>"May I play with you, then?" asked the
Prince. In the real world he had been too
fond of books to play much, but here he felt
as though he must do nothing but play all day
long.</p>

<p>"Of course you may," answered the dream
voices; "that is what you are here for."</p>

<p>Prince Brilliant was soon the happiest boy
possible. Some people might think it dull to
have playfellows who could not be seen, but
the Prince thought nothing could be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
delightful than to live in the midst of dreams
for the rest of his life. It is true that he was
fast forgetting everything that his Professor
had taught him; but this was hardly surprising,
for there is no room in a very small head
for serious thoughts as well as rose-coloured
ones.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether the Prince would
ever have wanted to go back to the real world
again, if he had not met the daddy-longlegs
one day, as he was strolling along with his
favourite dream.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said the daddy-longlegs, chuckling.
"I see it is time for you to go back into
the real world."</p>

<p>"What, already?" exclaimed the Prince.
"Why, you said I should have to wait years
and years and years and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have been here exactly seven years,"
interrupted the daddy-longlegs; "and it is
time for you to meet the waking-up dream."</p>

<p>The Prince suddenly began to remember
things. "When shall I be as tall as the Lady
Daffodilia?" he cried. But the daddy-longlegs
had no time to do anything but chuckle
before the waking-up dream came and seized
hold of the Prince, and he found himself falling,
falling, falling&mdash;down, down, down&mdash;until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
dropped with a thud on a soft grass lawn, and
found himself in the middle of the most beautiful
garden in the world. A little way off stood
an old grey castle; and as he lay looking at it
the gate swung open, and out stepped a dainty,
winsome little lady.</p>

<p>The Prince sprang to his feet with a shout
and held out his arms; and the Lady Daffodilia
ran straight into them without stopping
so much as to think.</p>

<p>"How <i>did</i> you learn to grow so tall?" she
asked, looking up at him.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Prince, truthfully, "I just
went into the world of dreams and waited till
I was grown up. You see, I was a boy and
not a girl, all the time; so I was not in such a
hurry as you to get my growing done early."</p>

<p>"I tried to grow as clever as you," sighed
Daffodilia, "but nothing would stop in my
head. I couldn't even say the exports and
imports of Fairyland without looking in the
book first!"</p>

<p>"Never mind," laughed the Prince; "I don't
believe there are any imports, for I am sure <i>we</i>
have nothing good enough to send there. And
as for the exports, there is only one thing that
Fairyland has sent into this country that is
worth remembering."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what is that?" she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"It is something that is not very tall and
not very serious and not very wise," answered
the Prince; "but it is sweet and merry and
charming, and it is called the Lady Daffodilia!"</p>

<h2>The Kite That Went to the Moon</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 465px;">
<img src="images/col05-tn.jpg" width="465" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>






<p>Jerry had made the biggest kite in the
village; and Chubby, the woodcutter's
daughter, had painted a big round moon on it
and several stars as well. That alone was
enough to show that it was by no means an
ordinary kite; so it was no wonder that Jerry
felt very proud of himself when he ran on to
the village green to fly it.</p>

<p>"Stand back, all of you!" he said, as the
girls and boys came crowding round him.
"Now, you shall see my kite fly to the
moon!"</p>

<p>No doubt, Jerry was inclined to make quite
enough fuss about his kite; but it is not every
day that one has a chance of flying the biggest
kite in the village, especially when one is only
seven years old. He felt very sad, however,
when he found that his kite had no intention
of flying to the moon. Every time he threw
it into the air, back it fell again on the grass;
and although he tried again and again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
used yards and yards of the very best string
that twopence-halfpenny could buy, any one
could see that something was decidedly wrong
with the biggest kite in the village.</p>

<p>Jerry turned red, and blinked his eyes, and
reminded himself desperately that he was seven
years old. It was certainly hard to have spent
six half-holidays in making a kite that would
not fly in the end.</p>

<p>"Stupid thing!" he muttered crossly. "If
I had the chance, just wouldn't I fly to the
moon! Kites don't know when they are well
off!"</p>

<p>But when all the boys and girls burst out
laughing, and pointed their fingers at him and
began to tease, it was impossible to keep back
his tears any longer. After all, one cannot
go on remembering for ever that one is seven
years old. The children, however, only laughed
the more, when the little maker of the kite
suddenly flung himself down on the ground
and began to cry.</p>

<p>"What is the use of a kite that won't fly?"
they jeered. "Take it home, Jerry, and make
it the same size as other people's kites! And
mind you let us know what the moon is like,
when your kite gets there!"</p>

<p>Jerry started to his feet again and shook his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
fist at them. "Some day," he shouted, "I shall
be able to laugh at you instead."</p>

<p>"When will that be, Jerry?" cried all the
boys and girls.</p>

<p>"When my kite has flown to the moon,"
answered Jerry, in a determined tone; and he
picked up his kite there and then, and marched
off to the school to find Chubby, the woodcutter's
daughter.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Chubby!" he said, popping his head
in at the schoolroom window. "Haven't you
done that sum yet?"</p>

<p>Chubby looked up with a doleful face. After
painting a moon and several stars on the biggest
kite in the village, it was not pleasant to
be kept in school just because seven would
not go into sixty-three.</p>

<p>"I shall never finish it, Jerry, never!" she
said with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Chubby," said Jerry, solemnly, "you've
been crying."</p>

<p>Chubby rubbed her eyes hastily with her two
fists. "I don't think so," she replied in a
muffled tone; "it was just three tears that
trickled down my nose and made a smudge on
the slate; but that isn't crying. You know it
isn't, Jerry!"</p>

<p>Jerry rubbed his own eyes a little guiltily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
"My kite wouldn't fly," he remarked, and tried
to look as though he did not care a bit.</p>

<p>"What!" cried Chubby. "Wouldn't your
kite fly? Then I never need have cried at all."</p>

<p>Jerry clambered on the window ledge and
sat there with his legs swinging to and fro. He
wished Chubby would not talk so much about
crying. "All the string got mixed up," he explained
with dignity; "I expect that was it."</p>

<p>"I don't," said Chubby, decidedly; "it was
because the tail was too short. I told you so,
all the time."</p>

<p>No doubt there was something in what she
said, but reasons are not much good when you
are seven years old and your kite won't fly,
and Jerry was not in a mood to be trifled with.</p>

<p>"If you know so much about it," he retorted,
"you'd better come and fly it yourself."</p>

<p>"I only wish I could," sighed poor little
Chubby. "If you'll tell me how many times
seven goes into&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't," interrupted Jerry, crossly. "How
can I do sums when my kite won't fly?"</p>

<p>Then he flung himself down from the window
ledge, and started off to find some one
who would tell him why his kite would not fly.
Half-way down the village street, he met a fine
black raven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good day to you," said Jerry, who knew
that ravens could explain most things if they
chose. "Can you tell me why my kite won't
fly?"</p>

<p>"Caw, caw!" croaked the raven. "Nine
times, Jerry, nine times! Caw, caw!"</p>

<p>"I wonder what he means," thought Jerry,
and trudged on a little farther. Presently he
met a sheep. Now, sheep do not know much
as a rule, but they are always extremely anxious
to tell what they do know. So Jerry asked
her at once why his kite would not fly.</p>

<p>"Baa, baa!" said the sheep. "Nine times,
Jerry, nine times! Baa, baa!"</p>

<p>"Everybody is going mad this afternoon,"
thought Jerry; and he went on a little farther.
Just at the end of the village, a cockchafer
came buzzing round his head.</p>

<p>"Buz-z-z!" hummed the cockchafer. "Nine
times, Jerry, nine times! Buz-z-z!"</p>

<p>"Oh, go away, do!" cried Jerry, impatiently.
"What do you all mean by nine times?"</p>

<p>The cockchafer did not go away an inch, but
buzzed closer to Jerry's head than before.
"Buz-z-z," he hummed; "nine times, Jerry,
nine times, nine times, nine times, nine
times&mdash;"</p>

<p>All at once, the cockchafer's meaning entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Jerry's head, which was hardly to be wondered
at, considering how close his head was at that
moment to the cockchafer.</p>

<p>"Of course it's nine times!" he cried.
"Why didn't I think of that before?" Then
he turned round and dragged his kite all the
way back to the school, where Chubby still sat
sighing over her sum.</p>

<p>"It goes nine times exactly, Chubby," he
told her through the window; "so now you
can come and help me to carry this great big
kite."</p>

<p>"Where are we going, Jerry?" asked Chubby,
when she had finished her sum and joined
him.</p>

<p>"We are going out into the world, to discover
the reason why my kite won't fly,"
answered Jerry; and between them they picked
up the biggest kite in the village and carried
it out into the world.</p>

<p>"How are we going to discover why your
kite won't fly?" asked Chubby, when they
had walked a good way. She had had no tea,
to tell the truth, and was beginning to feel
remarkably hungry.</p>

<p>"We will ask everybody we meet," said
Jerry, who had had his tea and was therefore
not at all hungry. "There is sure to be some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
one in the world who can tell us, and we will
not rest until we find him."</p>

<p>"We haven't met anybody yet," remarked
Chubby, rather dolefully. "How long do you
think we shall have to go on walking before
we find the right person?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps for years and years," answered
Jerry, cheerfully. "But if we are quick, we
may meet him sooner than that."</p>

<p>He quickened his steps as he spoke, and
Chubby had to run a little to keep up with
him. It was beginning to grow dark now,
and the country seemed more and more desolate.</p>

<p>"The world is not so full of people as I expected
to find it," said Jerry, in a disappointed
tone. "I do hope we shall soon meet some
one who will know why my kite won't fly."</p>

<p>Just then, he thought he heard something
from behind that sounded like a sob. Sure
enough, there was Chubby, wiping her eyes
with the corner of her pinafore.</p>

<p>"I'm so hungry," she sobbed. "I want my
tea. Can't we go home, Jerry, and put off seeing
the world until to-morrow?"</p>

<p>Jerry looked at her and sighed. If it had
been any one but Chubby, he would most certainly
have grumbled at her. As it was, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
only propped up the kite against the hedge
and made her sit down beside it.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I don't know the way home,"
he said; "but if you will wait here, I will go
and get you something to eat."</p>

<p>He was not at all sure where he was going
to find it, but he hastened along the road as
fast as he could and hoped he would soon
come to a house. Long before he came to a
house, however, he came to a man, a little old
man, who was carrying a large sack on his
shoulder. Directly he saw Jerry, he swung
the sack on to the ground and began untying
the mouth of it.</p>

<p>"Well, my little fellow," he said in a friendly
tone, "what do you want out of my bag?"</p>

<p>"That depends on what you have got in
your bag," answered Jerry, promptly.</p>

<p>"I have everything in the world in my bag,"
replied the little old man, "for everything is
there that everybody wants. I have laughter
and tears and happiness and sadness; I can
give you riches or poverty, sense or nonsense;
here is a way to discover the things that you
don't know, and a way to forget the things
that you do know. Will you have a toy that
changes whenever you wish, or a book that
tells you stories whenever you listen to it, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
pair of shoes in which you can dance from
boyhood into youth? Choose whatever you
like and it shall be yours; but remember, I
can only give you one thing out of my bag, so
think well before you make up your mind."</p>

<p>Jerry did not stop to think at all. "Have
you something to eat in your bag, something
that will please a hungry little girl who has
had no tea?" he asked.</p>

<p>The little old man smiled and pulled out a
small cake about the size of Jerry's fist. It
did not look as though it would satisfy any
one who was as hungry as Chubby; but as
the old man disappeared, sack and all, the
moment he had given Jerry the cake, it was
not much good complaining about it. So
back trotted Jerry to the place where he had
left Chubby; and greatly to his relief her face
beamed with joy directly she had eaten one
mouthful.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful cake!" she cried; "it
tastes like strawberry jam and toffee and ices,
and all the things I like best. And see! as
fast as I eat it, it comes again, so that I shall
never be able to finish it. Take some, Jerry."</p>

<p>"Why," said Jerry, as soon as he had taken
a bite, "it tastes like currant buns and ginger-beer
and all the things <i>I</i> like best. It is cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>tain
that we shall never starve as long as we
have a fairy cake like this." Then he told her
how he had come by it.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," remarked Chubby, "the little
old man could have told you why your kite
wouldn't fly."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he could," said Jerry, carelessly,
"but I didn't think to ask him. We'll come
along and ask the next person instead."</p>

<p>When, however, they looked round for the
kite, it was nowhere to be seen. The moon
came out obligingly from behind a cloud and
helped them as much as it could; but although
they searched for a long time, not a trace could
they find of the biggest kite in the village.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, oh dear!" sighed Chubby. "Perhaps
I went to sleep while you were away, and
somebody came along and took it. But I did
think I stopped awake, Jerry; I did indeed!"</p>

<p>"And so you did, to be sure!" cried a voice
from the hedge; "but you would have to be
very wide awake to keep <i>that</i> kite from giving
you the slip, as soon as the moon came
up!"</p>

<p>Of course, no one but a wymp would have
appeared like that, just in time to say the right
thing; so the children were not at all surprised
when a particularly wympish wymp came tum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>bling
out of the hedge and perched himself on
a thistle and wimpled at them.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you know where the
kite has gone?" asked both the children,
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Look up there and see," answered the
wymp, pointing to the sky.</p>

<p>The sky was covered with stars, hundreds
and thousands of them, all twinkling round the
moon just as Chubby had painted them on the
kite. Only, she could not help thinking that
her stars had more shape and were decidedly
more like stars than the real stars were; but
this, she supposed, might be because the real
stars were such a long way off. One of them
was different from all the others; it had a long
bright tail that glittered like a cracker at
Christmas time, and it was scurrying across
the sky at such a pace that the rest of the stars
had to get out of its way as best they could.
Most of the people who looked out of their
windows that night thought they saw a comet;
but Jerry and Chubby knew better.</p>

<p>"Oh," they cried, clapping their hands with
excitement. "There is our kite, and it <i>is</i> flying
to the moon after all!"</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about that," said the
wymp, who was still wimpling at them from
the top of the thistle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"But why did it not fly to the moon this
afternoon, when all the other boys were looking
on?" asked Jerry, regretfully.</p>

<p>"Because there wasn't a moon to fly to, of
course!" answered the wymp. "You shouldn't
expect too much, even from the biggest kite in
the village. Directly there <i>was</i> a moon, you
see, away it flew."</p>

<p>"Then, if I had painted the sun on it, instead
of the moon, it would have flown away this
afternoon!" exclaimed Chubby.</p>

<p>"Exactly so," said the wymp. "Now, what
ever induced you to paint a thing like the
moon on anybody's kite, eh?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, the moon is so nice and
easy," explained Chubby. "All you have to
do is to draw a circle round the biggest soup
plate you can find; and then you take away the
soup plate, and you paint in the eyes and the
nose and the mouth, and there you are! You
can't do much more than that with three paints
and a brush that's got hardly any hairs, can
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you can," retorted the wymp, "you
can paint the sun, and that's ever so much
better than painting the moon&mdash;nasty, silly,
chilly thing!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but you can't paint the sun when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
you've only got three paints," objected Chubby.
"It takes ever so many more paints than that
to make it shine properly; and even then, it
doesn't always."</p>

<p>"Shine!" repeated the wymp. "Who said
anything about shining? When I say the
sun, I mean the other side of the sun, of course.
<i>That</i> doesn't shine,&mdash;knows better, indeed!"</p>

<p>He seemed so hurt about it that Chubby
hastened to pacify him. "I'm very sorry," she
said. "Of course, I should like to paint your
side of the sun very much, but it is a little
difficult when I haven't ever been there, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is," admitted the wymp; "but
if that is all, I'll take you there this very minute.
Will you come?"</p>

<p>Chubby looked round; and there was Jerry
still gazing up at the star with the long tail,
that was causing so much commotion among
the countries of the sky. Just then, it reached
the moon and went straight into it with a big
splash; and Jerry heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>That decided Chubby. "If you please," she
said, turning to the wymp in a great hurry,
"I think we would rather go to the moon."</p>

<p>The wymp instantly flew into the most violent
passion. "What!" he exclaimed, shaking all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
over with indignation. "You would sooner go
to the moon than the back of the sun? Well,
I <i>am</i> sorry for you."</p>

<p>Chubby was just going to be frightened, when
Jerry came and put his arm round her protectingly.
"You see," he explained to the wymp,
"it's not the moon we want, it's the kite.
And the kite has gone to the moon, unfortunately.
I suppose I am glad it has gone," he
added rather doubtfully, "but I do wish it had
waited to take me with it."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said the wymp, calming down a
little, "if you are quite sure you don't <i>want</i> to
go to the moon, I shall have the greatest pleasure
in taking you there. I'll call a comet at
once." He put his fingers to his mouth and
blew a whistle that was long enough to reach
the countries of the sky. "Now I come to
think of it," he continued thoughtfully, "it is
a very good thing you did not want to go
to Wympland, because we should have been
obliged to wait until the morning."</p>

<p>"Why couldn't we go to-night?" asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>"Because there isn't a Wympland to go to,"
answered the wymp, promptly. "When the
sun goes down it takes the back of itself with
itself, and there isn't a Wympland again till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
next morning. I shouldn't be here now, if I
hadn't missed the last sunbeam this evening.
That is the worst of living in a place that disappears
every night."</p>

<p>"Oh, but it doesn't disappear really," said
Chubby, who wanted to show that she knew
a little geography; "the sun is shining somewhere
else at this very moment, only we can't
see it."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" said the wymp, scornfully.
"Don't you believe everything you're told
about the sun! Who said it didn't disappear,
eh? Has any one ever gone after it to
see?"</p>

<p>"N-no," said Chubby, doubtfully, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That proves it doesn't go on shining,
then," said the wymp, triumphantly. "There's
plenty of inquisitive people who'd have gone
after the sun long ago, if it hadn't the sense to
disappear every night. It must have some
peace, you know, if it's got to come up smiling
again the next morning."</p>

<p>"Do the wymps disappear every night, too?"
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>"Of course they do," answered the wymp.
"Don't you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know we did," said Jerry, a little
bewildered. "I thought we only went to sleep."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, you do that first," said the wymp.
"Then you disappear."</p>

<p>"No, we don't," said Chubby, positively.
"We shouldn't have dreams if we disappeared."</p>

<p>"You certainly wouldn't have any dreams
unless you did disappear," chuckled the wymp.</p>

<p>"Then what about to-night?" demanded
Jerry. "Do you mean to say we have disappeared
now?"</p>

<p>The wymp sighed. "Some people never
will know when they're not there," he complained.
"But here is our comet; jump in, or
else we shall be late."</p>

<p>Down swooped the great shining comet, and
there it lay across the road, waiting for them
to mount. The children climbed on to its
broad glittering tail and held tightly to each
other, while the wymp mounted in front of
them and stood like the man at the wheel, with
his hand on the comet's head; then up they
flew at a terrific pace, right through the wonderful
blue darkness that stretched all round
them. Far above was the great land of light
that lay round the moon; but the country of
the stars came in between, and the stars were
still so far off that they had not even begun to
look like real stars.</p>

<p>"Afraid of the dark?" asked the wymp over
his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Chubby. "I am only afraid
of the dark you get at home when the candle
is put out. This is a nice, friendly kind of
darkness, and candles wouldn't make any difference
to it."</p>

<p>"I don't know so much about that," said the
wymp; "if you had the steering to do, you
wouldn't mind a candle or two to help you."</p>

<p>"Do you steer by the points of the compass?"
asked Jerry, eagerly. Some one had given
him a compass on his last birthday, and he
had steered by it ever since. Indeed, he had
arrived late at school several times, through
steering his way by the points of the compass.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said the wymp; "when you
are sailing on a comet, you steer by the points
of the comet, of course." Just then, he gave a
sharp turn to the points of the comet, and it
sailed right out of the blue darkness and took
them into the dim mysterious greyness of the
country of the stars.</p>

<p>"They <i>are</i> like real stars," murmured Chubby,
for she had begun to have serious doubts
whether the stars she had painted on the kite
were not wrong after all. It was very comforting
to find that the stars that were whizzing
past them in hundreds and thousands
looked just like the stars she had been accus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>tomed
to see on Christmas trees, and had such
sharp points that it would not have been at all
pleasant to run against one of them by mistake.
Indeed, the wymp had as much as he
could do to steer through the country of the
stars without coming into collision with them,
although the comet did not make half so much
commotion in the sky as Jerry's kite had done.
But then, Jerry's kite had never been trained
to be a comet, and that made all the difference.</p>

<p>It grew lighter and lighter as they came
nearer the moon, and even the stars began to
look pale in the white light that was shining
so close to the edge of their country. The
stars were growing fewer, too, for stars naturally
prefer to shine in a place where they can
be seen, and just here, at the edge of their
country, they could hardly be seen at all. Then
the wymp gave another turn to the points of
the comet, and it glided gently from the country
of the stars into the pale white country of
the moon.</p>

<p>"It's like being inside a great flame that
isn't hot," whispered Chubby.</p>

<p>Even the wymp had to admit that the country
of the moon had something in its favour.
"For those who like light," he allowed, "the
moon is all very well. For my part, I prefer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Wympland, where there isn't any light at all.
You can't say that of any other country on
either side of the sun!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to say it," objected Chubby;
"I am very glad there <i>is</i> some light in my
country."</p>

<p>"But there isn't," retorted the wymp.
"There's only other people's light in your
country! Where would you be, if you didn't
borrow bits of light from the countries of the
sky, eh?"</p>

<p>Chubby thought it would be wiser to change
the conversation. "If you please," she said
politely, "can you tell me when we shall get to
the moon?"</p>

<p>"Why," laughed the wymp, "we are in the
moon now!"</p>

<p>Chubby looked round her in bewilderment.
"But where are the eyes and the nose and the
mouth?" she asked.</p>

<p>The wymp shook his head. "I am afraid,"
he said gravely, "that you must have found
them in the soup plate. Perhaps Jerry knows
where they are."</p>

<p>But Jerry was looking everywhere for something
that was far more important. Some
people might want to come all this way to look
for the man in the moon, but for his part he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
intended to find the biggest kite in the village,
the kite that had taken him six half-holidays to
make. "Do you think we shall find it soon?"
he asked impatiently.</p>

<p>Nobody answered him, for just then the
comet came to such a sudden standstill that all
three of them were nearly jerked off into the
air. It was not the comet's fault, however, for
right in its way was Jerry's kite; and it was
lucky for everybody, that night, that there was
not an extremely bad accident in the countries
of the sky.</p>

<p>"Why don't you look where you are going?"
asked the kite, in just the flippant fly away sort
of tone one would expect from a kite.</p>

<p>Jerry was so astonished at being addressed
in this impudent manner by a thing he had
made with his own hands, that he did not
know what to reply. The comet, however, was
a comet of a few words; and all it did was to
put its head down and rush straight at Jerry's
kite. There is no doubt that in another minute
there would have been a terrific battle in
the middle of the moon, if a strange, clear voice
from beyond had not spoken just in time to
stop it.</p>

<p>"Who is daring to make all this commotion
in my country?" said the voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hullo!" muttered the wymp, suddenly;
"I was expecting that. Good-bye, children;
I'm off!" And pointing his hands downward,
he took a dive from the head of the comet and
disappeared in the direction of the country of
the stars.</p>

<p>At the same instant, out from the pale white
distance of the country of the moon glided a
tall figure, as white and delicate and shimmering
as the light that surrounded it.</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;can it be the man in the moon?"
whispered Chubby to the boy beside her.</p>

<p>Then the figure came closer, and they saw
that it was a wonderful, mysterious-looking,
white witch-woman.</p>

<p>"I am the Lady of the Moon," she said, in
the same clear, cold voice. "Snow and stillness
and space are wherever I go; when I
smile, I make the whole world beautiful, but
my smile takes the colour away from the flowers
and the ripple away from the water and the
warmth away from the sunshine."</p>

<p>She looked round, and her eye lighted on
Jerry's kite. "What is that creature doing in
my country?" she demanded.</p>

<p>All the impudence seemed to have gone out
of the biggest kite in the village, for it lay
there trembling at the feet of the Lady of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Moon, and had not so much as a word to say
for itself. Jerry, however, summoned up courage
to answer for it. After all, it was through
him that the kite was there, and he naturally
felt bound to defend it.</p>

<p>"If you please," he said, "it is my kite. I
made it, all by myself,&mdash;it took six half-holidays;
and Chubby painted the moon and the
stars on it."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said Chubby, hurriedly, "that
the moon is not very much like the moon, but
it was the best I could do with three paints
and a brush that hadn't any hairs. The stars
are right," she added anxiously.</p>

<p>The Lady of the Moon smiled contemptuously.
"Stars, indeed!" she observed. "What
does it matter how the stars are painted? The
moon is far more important, and you have
made a regular muddle of that! And who
told you children that you might come into
my country, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"The wymp brought us," explained Jerry.
"He was here a minute ago, but he has just
left."</p>

<p>"No doubt he has," said the Lady of the
Moon, with a little laugh that made them
shiver. "Wymps know better than to come
in my way. I can turn their laughter into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
hoar-frost, and they don't like that. As for
you, unless you want to be frozen tight to the
middle of the moon for the rest of your lives,
you had better make haste home again."</p>

<p>Chubby was only too anxious to be off, for
she had no wish to spend the rest of her life
with some one who made people shiver whenever
she laughed. Jerry, however, did not
mean to have his journey to the moon for
nothing.</p>

<p>"Please, may I take my kite back with me?"
he asked boldly. "I want to show the other
boys and girls that it did fly to the moon after
all."</p>

<p>"That's all very well," objected the kite, who
had stopped trembling and become impudent
again; "but I don't want to go back among a
lot of girls and boys who do not know how to
appreciate me. When a fellow has once been
a comet, you cannot expect him to end his days
as a common kite."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said the Lady of the Moon, gathering
her mantle closely round her and stepping
away from them, "settle that among
yourselves, only please go out of my country
first. For my part, I must go and put the
finishing touches to that hoar-frost of mine
before dawn."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>She had hardly finished speaking when a
faint gleam of pink pierced the white light
around her and touched the edge of her mantle.
She gave a shrill cry instantly, and waved her
arms about her in the greatest excitement.</p>

<p>"Go, go, go! Dawn is coming, and you
will be swallowed up in the setting of the
moon," she screamed at them. "Go, go, go!"</p>

<p>Chubby began to feel tearful, for it is not
pleasant to be told that one is going to be
swallowed up in anything. But Jerry had a
sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>"Jump, Chubby, jump!" he shouted, seizing
her by the arm and springing away from the
comet. Chubby must have done as she was
told, for the next minute she found herself sitting
beside him, on the top of the biggest kite
in the village. As for the comet, it was only
too anxious to get back to the place where it
could shine and be seen; so it took a great dive
down into the country of the stars, just as the
wymp had done, and they never saw it again.</p>

<p>"Now," said Jerry sternly to his kite, "you've
just got to take us home straightway without
any more nonsense! If you want to stay and
be swallowed up, we don't. You can come
back again and be a comet for the rest of your
days, for all I care; but I'm determined that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
you shall show the village first that you know
how to fly. Now, down you go!"</p>

<p>Evidently, the kite felt that there was some
sense in Jerry's words, for it made no further
objections, but sailed swiftly out of the country
of the moon just in time to escape being swallowed
up. The downward journey was much
simpler than the one of the night before, for
the sun was rising as fast as it could, and the
stars were disappearing so rapidly that there
were hardly any of them left to get in the way.
This was a very good thing, for, as I said before,
Jerry's kite had not been trained to be a
comet, and it takes a good deal of steering to
get through the countries of the sky without
an accident on the way.</p>

<p>Chubby was hungry enough to remember
her fairy cake; and as it was nearly breakfast
time, of course it tasted of milk and porridge
and eggs and bacon. But Jerry refused to
touch a mouthful. He was busy thinking of
what the other boys and girls would say, when
they saw him come sailing home on his kite.</p>

<p>The sun was shining brightly, and the birds
were singing, and the children were laughing
on their way to school, when Jerry and Chubby
at last reached home on the biggest kite in the
village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" cried all the boys and girls, rushing
up to them in great excitement. "Here's
Jerry and Chubby been sailing about on the
biggest kite in the village! Where have you
been, Jerry?"</p>

<p>Jerry smiled in a superior manner, and waved
them all back with his hand.</p>

<p>"What a fuss you do make, to be sure!" he
observed. "Didn't I tell you my kite was
going to the moon?"</p>

<p>Then Jerry went home to breakfast; but
Jerry's kite sailed back to the countries of the
sky, and it has been a comet ever since.</p>
